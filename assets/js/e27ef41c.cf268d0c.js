But our requests were very heterogenous: the fastest ones were simple gcc compile commands that generated a single object file and could finish in 10s of milliseconds.

In many schedulers, each worker maintains a queue and the scheduler tries to assign work to the worker with the shortest queue. The problem with this, and one of the core reasons it doesn't give good performance on our workloads, is that queue length is not a good indicator of how long a task will take. Late-binding solves this by enqueuing a task on multiple workers, and then the first worker to get to the task takes it. This effectively avoids the problems of huge single tasks blocking other work."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Another reason this paper is so great is because the authors actually implemented Sparrow, ported Apache Spark to use it, and then analyzed the results.

It maybe took a few days, which was far less time than I'd spent trying to find alternative solutions. The lead author of the paper was even happy to help clarify things over email. And when I replaced our load balancer with it, the results were pretty much instantly far better than anything we'd had before. No longer were builds timing out because of unequal load distribution.
