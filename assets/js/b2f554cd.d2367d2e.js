Read on for the nitty-gritty details.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Containerization\\n\\nAt BuildBuddy, we use containers to isolate actions and support arbitrary code execution on our hosted remote execution service. In production we use Podman as our default container runtime, but we support Docker and Firecracker as well. One significant challenge we encounter with our container setup is that pulling a container image after cold start can be quite slow. Our executor images are about one gigabyte and it typically takes about 30 seconds to pull and extract them in our GCP production environment. Some client-provided images tip the scales at over 10GB and can take minutes to pull and extract.\\n\\nNot only does significant image pull latency directly slow down customer builds and tests, it also limits our ability to autoscale the executor pool and respond to heavy load. When new BuildBuddy executors start up, they pull container images as needed. This means the first action using an image that runs on an executor incurs the latency of pulling that image and blocks other queued actions using the same image. So the faster we can pull container images the faster we can spin up new executors and start running customer-submitted actions. We could address this problem by always running more executors, or preemptively scaling the executor pool during peak hours, but at best these tricks only partially solve this problem and have other drawbacks.\\n\\n[Lazy image distribution](https://medium.com/nttlabs/startup-containers-in-lightning-speed-with-lazy-image-distribution-on-containerd-243d94522361) provides a more promising solution. The premise is that most parts of a container image are unnecessary for most container runs, so instead of eagerly fetching the entire image upfront, pieces of the image\u2019s layers can be retrieved by the container runtime as needed. The [stargz-snapshotter](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter) implements a lazy image fetcher based on the eStargz custom image format, and the [soci-snapshotter](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter) provides one based on the OCI specification for those who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to convert images to a new format to support lazy distribution.\\n\\n## SOCI Snapshotter\\n\\nThe SOCI Snapshotter acts as a local container layer store that containerd can use to retrieve image layers in place of the remote registry. Lazily fetched images must be indexed, which involves creating a zip table of contents (ZToC) indexing the contents of each container image layer, and bundling these ZToCs in a json file called the \\"SOCI Index\\" that associates ZToCs with the layers they index. Given an image, the `soci create` tool takes care of creating all of these artifacts. Once these ZToCs and the SOCI Index are created, most snapshotter users will push these artifacts to the remote container registry where they\u2019re associated with the container image using either the referrers API or a fallback mechanism involving tags. Then, other SOCI Snapshotter instances can retrieve the SOCI Index and ZToCs and use those to determine where container fileystem locations exist in each layer\'s targz file and fetch only parts of the layer files as needed.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/soci-snapshotter.webp)\\n_A typical soci-snapshotter setup. SOCI artifacts are stored in and retrieved from the container registry and used to lazily pull parts of the image as needed._\\n\\n## BuildBuddy + SOCI Snapshotter\\n\\nWe have a couple of caveats that prevent us from using the SOCI Snapshotter with BuildBuddy executors out-of-the-box. First, we\'d like to continue to use Podman as our default container runtime, and second, we want to support lazy image distribution for container images in read-only registries -- requiring our customers to either give us write access to their container registries or add an additional image indexing step to their image deployments is a nonstarter for us.\\n\\nWe solved the first problem by porting the Podman support in the stargz-snapshotter to the soci-snapshotter. This involved creating a new binary in the SOCI Snapshotter, the `soci-store`, and hooking that up to run the [store/fs.go](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/store/fs.go) filesystem implementation.\\n\\nThe second problem posed a little bit more of a challenge. We needed a different mechanism for storing the SOCI Index, ZToCs, and the association between a container image and its SOCI Index. Fortunately for us, the SOCI artifacts (Index and ZToCs) are content-addressable and we know how to store [content-addressable blobs](https://bazel.build/remote/caching)! The final piece, the association between the image and its SOCI Index, isn\u2019t content-addressable, it\u2019s just a string-to-string mapping. But the BuildBuddy cache also supports storing non-content-addressable contents keyed by a hash. So we store the image-to-index mapping by salting and hashing the image identifier, to support versioning, and adding a cache entry under that key with a value containing the digest of the SOCI Index, which is retrievable from the content-addressable store.\\n\\nTo support all of these modifications, we added a bit of logic to the snapshotter that attempts to retrieve artifacts from the local filesystem before the remote registry and supports reading the image-to-index mapping from the local filesystem under a special directory, again keyed by the image identifier. Finally, we set up the app and executor to look for all of these artifacts in the cache, generate them if they\u2019re not present, and store them on the local filesystem so the snapshotter can do its thing.\\n\\nThe modified soci-snapshotter is available at [github.com/buildbuddy-io/soci-snapshotter](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/soci-snapshotter).\\n\\n![](/img/blog/soci-snapshotter-buildbuddy.webp)\\n_The BuildBuddy + soci-snapshotter setup. SOCI artifacts are generated on-demand in the App, stored in the cache, and retrieved by the Executor as needed._\\n\\n## Authorization\\n\\nMany of our customer\u2019s container images are password protected in the container registry. We share user-provided registry credentials between the executors and the soci-snapshotter so the snapshotter can fetch registry artifacts as needed, but these credentials expire after a short time period. The setup described here doesn\u2019t permit any unauthorized access to container images or their derived artifacts. The SOCI artifacts are only generated and retrieved for authorized image pull operations, just like standard `podman pull` requests.\\n\\n## Cache Eviction\\n\\nWe continuously evict the oldest unused artifacts from the BuildBuddy caches to make room for fresh data, and SOCI artifacts are no exception to this. Fortunately, the average last-access-time (including reads) of evicted items for most customers is old enough that only artifacts for rarely pulled container images are affected. Container images used regularly in remote execution or CI only require re-indexing except after being updated in the container registry.\\n\\n## Bugs!\\n\\nAfter initially rolling out lazy image distribution to our executors, we saw intermittent build and test failures due to `Input/output errors` running binaries inside of containers. We tracked this down to [a bug](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/6377) in the containerd docker authorization library that caused it to re-use expired authentication tokens a bit too eagerly. Fortunately, there was a pretty straightforward [workaround](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/soci-snapshotter/pull/2) while we wait for an [upstream fix](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8735/files).\\n\\nWe also observed occasional panics in the soci-store running in our development and production setups. To gather more data, we ran a version compiled with the go race detector in our development environment for a few weeks and tracked down two sources of these panics. First, we observed unprotected multithreaded access to data cached in in-memory inodes which was easily fixed by protecting those accesses with a mutex, a change that we [pushed upstream](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter/pull/833). We noticed this issue before the upstream maintainers because we concurrently pull two container images on executor startup, sometimes within less than a millisecond, a behavior that exacerbates latent multithreading bugs like this. And second, both the soci-store and the SOCI Snapshotter were affected by a bug in the go-fuse library that caused them to return incorrect values for some `Lseek` calls. This lead to out-of-bounds reads of soci-store in-memory files, and panics. This was easily fixed by upgrading the soci-store\'s go-fuse dependency past [github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/pull/488](https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/pull/488) which fixed the bug. Interestingly, this bug [manifested slightly differently](https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter/issues/829) in the SOCI Snapshotter, but thankfully the same solution addressed both symptoms. Both of these bugs occurred pretty infrequently and were difficult to reproduce, so we were thankful for the additional information from the go race detector.\\n\\nFinally, we encountered issues caused by private container registry credentials expiring mid-run. We were able to fix these problems by hooking up the background layer fetcher in the SOCI Snapshotter with the newly introduced soci-store binary, reducing the likelihood that a container layer part will be requested after the supplied credentials have expired.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nWe\'ve been using the lazy image distribution mechanism described here in our development environment for a few months and have observed an almost tenfold decrease in image pull latency after cold start, from about 30 seconds to about 4 seconds for our executor images in the common case where the SOCI artifacts are available in the cache. In the rare case where the SOCI artifacts are unavailable, container image setup is about 10% slower due to the need to pull the image, index it, and fetch the SOCI artifacts from the executor. After testing this setup in dev, we rolled it out to all BuildBuddy cloud customers in two phases. Earlier this summer we enabled lazy image distribution for all publicly pullable container images and this month we enabled it for images stored in private container image registries. We\'ve observed the same almost tenfold decrease in image pull latency for customer images with no action required by our customers.\\n\\nBecause lazy image distribution defers layer fetching from pull-time to run-time, it\'s expected that some container run operations are slightly slower -- specifically, when part of a layer is needed but not available locally, it must be fetched from the remote registry at run-time. Fortunately, our container operation throughput is high enough that this performance penalty isn\'t noticeable in our environment.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited about the promise of lazily fetching remote resources in more circumstances and hope to build on what we\'ve learned from this project to continue to improve the BuildBuddy remote-execution platform.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about BuildBuddy\u2019s remote execution service or any of the other features we offer, or give them a try, check out our [documentation](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/introduction/).

When cache\\nreads and writes are performed, the [XChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) algorithm is\\nused to encrypt, decrypt and authenticate the data using this master key.\\n\\nRevocation of either the customer-supplied key or the BuildBuddy-managed key renders previously written artifacts undecryptable.\\n\\nBoth the encryption design and source code have been audited by a third party.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or feedback about this feature, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://community.buildbuddy.io/)\\nor at [security@buildbuddy.io](mailto:security@buildbuddy.io)."},{"id":"buck2-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/buck2-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/edit/master/website/blog/buck2.md","source":"@site/blog/buck2.md","title":"Buck2 Unboxing","description":"A review of Meta\'s new build tool Buck2.","date":"2023-05-30T12:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"buck2","permalink":"/blog/tags/buck-2"},{"label":"engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"}],"readingTime":19.225,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Son Luong Ngoc","title":"Solution Engineer @ BuildBuddy","url":"https://github.com/sluongng/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26684313?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"buck2-review","title":"Buck2 Unboxing","description":"A review of Meta\'s new build tool Buck2.","author":"Son Luong Ngoc","author_title":"Solution Engineer @ BuildBuddy","date":"2023-05-30:12:00:00","author_url":"https://github.com/sluongng/","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26684313?v=4","image":"/img/blog/buck2-header.png","tags":["buck2","engineering"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Providing Control Over Cache Encryption","permalink":"/blog/customer-managed-encryption-keys"},"nextItem":{"title":"Keyboard Shortcuts in BuildBuddy","permalink":"/blog/keyboard-shortcuts"}},"content":"Recently Meta announced the release of Buck2, their official build tool that was rewritten in Rust.\\nI got a chance to try it and integrate it with BuildBuddy\'s Remote Cache and Remote Build Execution offerings.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/buck2.jpg)\\n\\nHere are the initial impressions I have after a week of using Buck2.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**Edit** (2023-06-15): The Bazel team did reach out to me with some corrections to how the benchmark\\nwas setup. Please find revised numbers at bottom of this blog.\\n\\nSimilar to Buck(1) and Bazel, Buck2 is an [artifact-based](https://bazel.build/basics/artifact-based-builds) build tool that operates on a large graph of dependencies.\\n\\nBuck2 was rewritten from scratch in Rust while providing many backward compatibility features with Buck(1).\\nOn the [official website of Buck2](https://buck2.build/docs/why/), Meta touted it to be:\\n\\n1. Remote Execution first\\n2. Dynamic graph computation engine\\n3. A single build phase\\n\\nSo how true are these claims?\\nIs Buck2 going to replace Bazel?\\nIs this the right tool for your needs?\\n\\nLet\'s dive in!\\n\\n## The pros\\n\\n#### Incredible CLI UX\\n\\nRight out of the box, Buck2 feels incredibly responsive.\\nThe command line is ridiculously fast compared to Bazel 6.2.0.\\nHere, we are using [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) to benchmark the two build tools.\\n\\n```bash\\n> hyperfine \'buck2 --version\' --shell=none --warmup 3 --runs 20\\nBenchmark 1: buck2 --version\\n  Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):       5.5 ms \xb1   0.6 ms    [User: 2.7 ms, System: 1.4 ms]\\n  Range (min \u2026 max):     5.0 ms \u2026   7.1 ms    20 runs\\n\\n> hyperfine \'bazel version\' --shell=none --warmup 3 --runs 20\\nBenchmark 1: bazel version\\n  Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):      31.2 ms \xb1   0.7 ms    [User: 9.7 ms, System: 11.8 ms]\\n  Range (min \u2026 max):    29.8 ms \u2026  32.4 ms    20 runs\\n```\\n\\nMoreover, the CLI was written in Rust\'s Clap library, which comes with a sane help menu\\nand (soon to come) auto-completion.\\n\\n```bash\\n> buck2 -h\\nbuck2 42652bf853883e0391382f6b8d038fe6 <local>\\nA build system\\n\\nDocumentation: https://buck2.build/docs/\\n\\nUSAGE:\\n    buck2 [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n    -h, --help\\n            Print help information\\n\\n        --isolation-dir <ISOLATION_DIR>\\n            Instances of Buck2 share a daemon if and only if their isolation directory is identical.\\n            The isolation directory also influences the output paths provided by Buck2, and as a\\n            result using a non-default isolation dir will cause cache misses (and slower builds)\\n            [env: BUCK_ISOLATION_DIR=] [default: v2]\\n\\n    -v, --verbose <NUMBER>\\n            How verbose buck should be while logging.

Local Execution\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   > cat .bazelrc\\n   build:local --strategy=local\\n   build:local --jobs=200\\n   build:local --local_cpu_resources=200\\n   build:local --local_ram_resources=\'HOST_RAM*2.0\'\\n   ```\\n\\n   It\'s worth noting that Bazel executes actions in a sandbox by default, so `--strategy=local` is used here to explicitly disable sandboxing.\\n   We also set Bazel\'s concurrency limit to 200 by specifying `--jobs=200` and override Bazel\'s system resource estimations by specifying\\n   `--local_cpu_resources` and `--local_ram_resources` to larger values.\\n   Because our actions are lightweight, with majority of the time being spent on `sleep(1)` call,\\n   these Bazel flags enable us to hit the \\"200 concurrent build actions\\" mark.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   > hyperfine --prepare \'bazel clean\' --warmup 1 \'bazel test --config=local //...\'\\n   Benchmark 1: bazel test --config=local //...\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):     65.631 s \xb1  0.460 s    [User: 0.051 s, System: 0.063 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):   65.179 s \u2026 66.310 s    10 runs\\n   ```\\n\\n   To ensure fairness, we also set Buck2 execution concurrency to the same value as Bazel:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   > tail -2 .buckconfig\\n   [build]\\n   threads = 200\\n   ```\\n\\n   Here, Buck\'s Starlark API differs slightly from Bazel\'s, so some small modifications were needed.\\n   For example:\\n\\n   ```diff\\n   @@ -21,9 +21,9 @@\\n    [\\n        genrule(\\n            name = \\"z_{}\\".format(n),\\n   -        outs = [\\"z_{}.txt\\".format(n)],\\n   +        out = \\"z_{}.txt\\".format(n),\\n   -        cmd = \\"cat $(location :x_{n}) $(location :y_{n}) > $@\\".format(n = n),\\n   +        cmd = \\"cat $(location :x_{n}) $(location :y_{n}) >$OUT\\".format(n = n),\\n   -        tools = [\\n   +        srcs = [\\n                \\":x_{}\\".format(n),\\n                \\":y_{}\\".format(n),\\n            ],\\n   ```\\n\\n   With all that set, let\'s see how Buck2 performs:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   > hyperfine  --prepare \'buck2 clean\' --warmup 1 \'buck2 test //...\'\\n   Benchmark 1: buck2 test //...\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):     41.175 s \xb1  2.183 s    [User: 0.371 s, System: 0.190 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):   37.584 s \u2026 43.803 s    10 runs\\n   ```\\n\\n   And quite a performance indeed, Buck2 left Bazel in the dust!\\n\\n2. Remote Execution\\n\\n   Using BuildBuddy as the RBE backend should be as simple as copying the configurations from the website:\\n\\n   ```\\n   build:remote --jobs=600\\n\\n   build:remote --bes_results_url=https://app.buildbuddy.io/invocation/\\n   build:remote --bes_backend=grpcs://remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   build:remote --remote_cache=grpcs://remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   build:remote --remote_timeout=3600\\n   build:remote --remote_executor=grpcs://remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   build:remote --remote_header=x-buildbuddy-api-key=<redacted>\\n   ```\\n\\n   With that set, let\'s check the result:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   # With remote cache\\n   > hyperfine --prepare \'bazel clean\' \\\\\\n               --warmup 1 \\\\\\n               \'bazel test --config=remote //...\'\\n   Benchmark 1: bazel test --config=remote //...\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):      9.798 s \xb1  0.515 s    [User: 0.028 s, System: 0.039 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):    8.645 s \u2026 10.434 s    10 runs\\n\\n   # Without remote cache\\n   # Set remote_instance_name to a random string to reset remote_cache\\n   > hyperfine  --prepare \'bazel clean\' \\\\\\n                --warmup 1 \\\\\\n                \'bazel test --config=remote --remote_instance_name=\\"$RANDOM\\" //...\'\\n   Benchmark 1: bazel test --config=remote --remote_instance_name=\\"$RANDOM\\" //...\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):     106.062 s \xb1  3.106 s    [User: 0.090 s, System: 0.099 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):   102.111 s \u2026 111.645 s    10 runs\\n   ```\\n\\n   10 seconds is amazing compared to the local execution time of 65 seconds.\\n   It\'s 84% faster with Remote Build Execution and Remote Cache!\\n\\n   But what about Buck2?\\n   Well setting it up is as simple as copying the provided configurations in [Buck2\'s BuildBuddy Example](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/examples/remote_execution/buildbuddy)\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   [build]\\n   execution_platforms = root//platforms:platforms\\n\\n   # [buck2_re_client]\\n   engine_address = remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   action_cache_address = remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   cas_address = remote.buildbuddy.io\\n   http_headers = x-buildbuddy-api-key:<redacted>\\n   ```\\n\\n   Let\'s run it:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   # With remote cache\\n   > hyperfine --prepare \'buck2 clean\' \\\\\\n               --warmup 1 \\\\\\n               \'buck2 test --unstable-allow-all-tests-on-re //...\'\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):      7.937 s \xb1  0.487 s    [User: 0.296 s, System: 0.175 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):    7.357 s \u2026  8.945 s    10 runs\\n\\n   # Without remote cache\\n   > hyperfine --prepare \'buck2 clean; echo \\"INSTANCE_NAME = \\\\\\"$RANDOM\\\\\\"\\" > instance.bzl\' \\\\\\n               \'buck2 test --unstable-allow-all-tests-on-re //...\'\\n   Benchmark 1: buck2 test --unstable-allow-all-tests-on-re //...\\n     Time (mean \xb1 \u03c3):     203.431 s \xb1 29.882 s    [User: 4.187 s, System: 1.566 s]\\n     Range (min \u2026 max):   163.044 s \u2026 258.968 s    10 runs\\n   ```\\n\\n   Buck2 does not have a good way to invalidate the remote cache to give a fair comparison,\\n   so I did apply a workaround by invalidating all the `x` and `y` actions with a random value instead.\\n\\n   Regardless, the performance was very impressive.\\n   The Remote Build Execution client of Buck2 is not as configurable as Bazel, so it was harder to tune.\\n   I expect it will make builds perform much better in the future.\\n\\n#### Easy to contribute\\n\\nSeriously, Buck2 code base is a blast to work with.\\nUnlike Bazel, which was written in a mix of C++ and Java using Google\'s homegrown frameworks,\\nBuck2 was built with a single language: Rust!\\n\\nNot only can the code base be built using Buck2, but it could also be built using Cargo, and\\nis completely compatible with Rust Analyzer (Rust\'s Language Server).\\nIt has been a long time since I could open the code base of a build tool and have \\"Go to definitions\\"\\nand \\"Find references\\" work out of the box.\\n\\nThe Buck2 team in Meta has been quite engaging thus far.\\nIt often takes them less than a week to respond to my GitHub Issues / Pull Requests.\\nAnd most of the time, I get a response within a day.\\n\\nDiving into Buck2 and its Rust code base is... addictive. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n## The cons\\n\\n> So is that it? Buck2 is faster, let\'s all move there?\\n\\nNot so fast young padawan!\\nBuck2 does come with some downsides.\\n\\n#### It\'s actually multiple phases!\\n\\nIn contrary to it\'s official introduction, [Buck2\'s architecture diagram](https://buck2.build/docs/developers/architecture/buck2/)\\ndescribes multiple phases and stages inside a typical build.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/buck2_architecture.png)\\n\\nThere seems to be 5 Phases acting as transitions between 5 states of Buck2 dynamic build graph, [DICE](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/dice).\\n\\nThe good thing about Buck2 is that none of these phases are \\"blocking\\", and thus multiple targets could\\ntransition through different states in great parallelization. Bazel is also trying to work toward this\\nsetup with the recently announced [SkyMeld project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEJLHNNRP9U&list=PLxNYxgaZ8RsdH4GCIZ69dzxQCOPyuNlpF&index=10).\\n\\n#### No Build Telemetry\\n\\nFirst of all, because Buck2 does not implement Bazel\'s Build Event Stream protocol (not part of Remote Execution API),\\nwe are not able to integrate with it to display your test results and provide you with sweet cache hit/miss analysis as we have with Bazel.\\n\\nBuck2 does come with a proto-defined set of `BuckEvent` data.\\nCurrently, these log-like data are stored locally under `buck-out/log` and could be interacted with using troubleshooting commands such as `buck2 what-failed`.\\n\\nInternally in Meta, these log data are sent to their [message queue system Scribe](https://engineering.fb.com/2019/10/07/data-infrastructure/scribe/) using Thrift RPC, which is consumed by their Telemetry Data platform [Scuba](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook/).\\nHowever, there is no open-source implementation equivalent and I created [buck2/issue/226](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/226) to discuss the creation of one.\\n\\n#### No Repository Phase\\n\\nIn Bazel, external dependencies to the build are prepared before build execution happens, in the \\"Repository Phase\\".\\n\\nBuck2 is touted to be a single phases build tool, so how does it manage 3rd party dependencies then?\\nCurrently, there are only a limited set of options:\\n\\n1. Git submodules\\n   Buck2 comes with **Prelude**, an open-source git repository that is meant to help define most Buck2 build rules.\\n   However, for each new Buck2 project being created with `buck2 init`, you would need to set up Prelude as a git submodule in your git repo.\\n   Without prelude, you would not get access to even basic rules such as `genrule` or `sh_binary`.\\n\\n2. Vendor\\n   Since the majority of Buck2 is written in Rust, the companion tool **Reindeer** helps you vendor all\\n   Cargo external packages into the repository and set up appropriate `BUCK` files for them.\\n   This is not a problem for Meta internally, with their custom monorepo and virtual file system [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com/),\\n   but it should be a huge problem for Git repos and code review systems in the open-source world.\\n\\n3. Anon target and dynamic outputs\\n   Although there is no repository phase, you could still define `http_archive` to have external downloads happen during Buck2 build execution.\\n   However, you will not be able to export build targets out of these newly downloaded archives easily.\\n   Instead of the Bazel approach which lets you run some commands to generate `BUILD` files,\\n   Buck2 provides the complicated anon target, sub-targets, and dynamic outputs APIs in Starlark for you to accomplish the same thing.\\n   However, there is very limited documentation and examples of how these APIs work.\\n\\n#### Complicated testing abstraction\\n\\nUnlike Bazel, which treats tests as another build action to be executed at the end of the graph,\\nBuck2 took this to a whole new level by introducing a new RPC to integrate Buck2 with their internal testing platform [TPX](https://buck2.build/docs/rule_authors/test_execution/).\\n\\nBecause TPX is in charge of coordinating test executions on various platforms and collecting related test outputs data,\\nthe set of APIs that define integration between Buck2 and TPX is also quite featureful.\\nHowever, there is not a lot of documentation at this moment regarding how these work.\\n\\nBecause of this reason, there is no test caching in Buck2 by default as the test target selector is supposed to be handled. But there are ongoing conversation about this in [buck2/issue/183](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/183).\\n\\n#### Other foot guns\\n\\nThere are several pain points I experienced while testing out Buck2. They range from small annoyances to rendering the tool completely un-usable \ud83d\ude13:\\n\\n- `http_archive` does not work from within anon target. Fixed in [buck2/commit/370cd4d](https://github.com/facebook/buck2-prelude/commit/370cd4d8b2cd002e0f794b91520febcab289b7d0).\\n\\n- All Go rules are not usable without a standard library to compile/link against. Reported in [buck2/issue/240](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/240).\\n\\n- Lack of documentation for `.buckconfig` keys and default values. Reported in [buck2/issue/152](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/152).\\n\\n- No local cache for external downloads (leading to re-download happening on a Buck Daemon reset). Reported in [buck2/issue/246](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/246).\\n\\n- Terminal UI reported the wrong value for actions counts. Reported in [buck2/issue/251](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/251).\\n\\n- Remote Execution does not have symlinks support [buck2/issue/222](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/222).\\n\\n- Simply crash and not usable [buck2/issue/257](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues/257), but fixed with [buck2/commit/7947156](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/commit/79471567dd5e05f4035515c697e3fb9ef78622ac).\\n\\n## The verdict\\n\\n> So what does all this mean?\\n>\\n> Should I start using Buck2 today?\\n\\nBuck2 is a fresh, new shiny build tool on the block.\\nWith it comes a lot of good things:\\n\\n- Great language, great performance\\n\\n- Fresh UI\\n\\n- Compatibility with existing RBE services\\n\\nIt has all the joy and excitement of a typical green field project that attracts the Rust (and potentially C++) community toward it.\\n\\n> But is it a Bazel replacement?\\n>\\n> Should an enterprise consider adopting this for hundreds to thousands of users?\\n\\nI would say _not yet_!\\n\\n- There are still too many foot guns that come with the new tool (as documented above).\\n\\n- There is not enough configurations and/or documentation to support large-scale enterprise users.\\n\\n- Users are expected to be hands-on with the code base. If you don\'t know Rust... well you better learn it first.\\n\\n- Lack of build rules and toolings for typical use cases: building a container image, a typescript project, a go binary... are not possible just yet.\\n\\nMy conclusion is that Buck2 is exciting!\\nHowever, today, it\'s still young and too early to replace typical enterprise use cases.\\nI hope the current excitement could grow a community and ecosystem around Buck2 sustainably to further drive the tool to maturity.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I have created a repository to collect [all Buck2-related resources here](https://github.com/sluongng/awesome-buck2).\\nIf you are interested in Buck2, give it a look!\\n\\n## Update (2023-06-15)\\n\\nShortly after this blog post was released, [Tobias Werth](https://github.com/meisterT) from the Bazel team pointed out to me\\nthat the Bazel setup was not the most optimized.\\n\\nIn particular, instead of using the `tools` attribute in Bazel\'s `genrule`, I should have used `srcs` instead.\\n\\n```diff\\n--- a/BUILD.bazel\\n+++ b/BUILD.bazel\\n@@ -26,28 +26,28 @@ SLEEP_CMD = \\"sleep $$((RANDOM % 5));\\"\\n [\\n     genrule(\\n         name

)\\n```\\n\\nUsing `tools` would cause Bazel to configure twice the number of actions underneath due to Bazel\'s special treatment of tool dependencies.\\nAnd fewer actions means a faster build.\\n\\nSo I reran the benchmark and here are the new results:\\n\\n| Tools            |          Local Build | RBE (with Remote Cache) | RBE (without Remote Cache) |\\n| :--------------- | -------------------: | ----------------------: | -------------------------: |\\n| buck2            | `41.175 s \xb1 2.183 s` |    ` 7.937 s \xb1 0.487 s` |     `203.431 s \xb1 29.882 s` |\\n| bazel w.

\u200e 2.975 s` |\\n\\nThis means that if setup correctly, Bazel performance is quite competitive with Buck2.\\nDifferences of a few seconds could be negligible for most use cases.\\n\\nAnother point of improvement is using the default BuildBuddy setting, we are uploading Bazel\'s Build Events to BuildBuddy on each build.\\nWith Buck2, there is an equivalent Buck2 Event system.\\nHowever, as noted in the blog post, Buck2 Event system is not yet compatible with systems outside of Meta so it\'s not possible to test with it just yet.\\n\\nSo to achieve a more accurate test result, we could move Bazel\'s Build Event upload to a separate config as follows:\\n\\n```diff\\n--- a/.bazelrc\\n+++ b/.bazelrc\\n@@ -14,12 +14,14 @@ build:remote --host_platform=//platforms:platform_linux\\n

Since early in rules_xcodeproj\u2019s\\ndevelopment, being able to have more than the default Debug configuration has\\nbeen highly requested. We would have implemented support much sooner, but\\nbecause rules_xcodeproj accounts for every file path and compiler/linker flag,\\nin order to have rock solid indexing and debugging support, it wasn\u2019t an easy\\ntask.\\n\\n[version-1.3]: https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj/releases/tag/1.3.2\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n# The challenge\\n\\nrules_xcodeproj uses a Bazel aspect to collect all of the information about your\\nbuild graph. It also uses Bazel split transitions in order to apply variations\\nof certain flags in order to support simulator and device builds in a single\\nproject. It seems that it should have been pretty easy to extend this method to\\napply to Xcode configurations as well, right? There were two problems to being\\nable to do that nicely, and we only really solved one of them at this time.\\n\\nThe common way that Bazel developers express various configurations is by\\ndefining various configs in `.bazelrc` files, and then using the `--config`\\nstanza to select them. So, that brings us to our first problem: Bazel\\ntransitions can\u2019t transition on `--config`. Because of our nested invocation\\narchitecture, we are able to apply a single `--config` to the inner invocation,\\nand we\u2019ve had support for this for a while. Being able to transition on\\n`--config` would have allowed us to support multiple Xcode configurations a lot\\nsooner. Of note, in the solution we\u2019ve implemented, you still can\u2019t use\\n`--config`, and need to list out all the flags you want for each configuration.\\nThis is because of this limitation of transitions.\\n\\nFor now we\u2019ve decided to continue to use transitions, and wanted to extend our\\napproach to cover multiple configurations as well. That brought us to our second\\nproblem: transitions are specified as part of a rule definition, and Bazel\\nmacros can\u2019t create anonymous rule. The easy approach to this would have been to\\nrequire users to define transitions in `.bzl` files (with the help of some\\nmacros), and then reference them in their `xcodeproj` targets (which are\\nactually macros, not rules). This would go against one of our driving principles\\nof only needing a single `xcodeproj` target for all but the most complicated\\nsetups, as we believe Xcode configurations are a fundamental aspect of projects\\nthat everyone should be able to easily specify.\\n\\n# The solution\\n\\nThe solution we implemented allows you to specify a dictionary of transition\\nsettings in the `xcodeproj.xcode_configurations` attribute. Given the\\npreviously mentioned limitations, you may be wondering how we were able to\\naccomplish this. Earlier I mentioned our nested invocation architecture, which\\ncalls `bazel run` in `runner.sh` (the script that is invoked when you call\\n`bazel run //:xcodeproj`). We leverage this architecture to generate a Bazel\\npackage in an external repository. This package contains a `BUILD` file with a\\ntarget using the actual `xcodeproj` rule, along with a `.bzl` file that defines\\na custom transition containing information from\\n`xcodeproj.xcode_configurations`. And just like how a solution for a previous\\nfeature was built upon to enable another feature (i.e. nested invocations which\\nenabled isolated build configurations, was built on for generated packages to\\nenable multiple Xcode configurations), we should be able to build on this\\nsolution the same way (e.g. to enable automatic target discovery).\\n\\nHere is an example of how you could specify Debug and Release configurations:\\n\\n```python\\nxcodeproj(\\n    ...\\n    xcode_configurations = {\\n        \\"Debug\\": {\\n            \\"//command_line_option:compilation_mode\\": \\"dbg\\",\\n        },\\n        \\"Release\\": {\\n            \\"//command_line_option:compilation_mode\\": \\"opt\\",\\n        },\\n    },\\n    ...\\n)\\n```\\n\\nWe think the end result is a good starting point, but can be refined futher in\\nfuture releases.

Like a lot of software engineers, I\u2019m pretty\\nbad at estimating, and thought that I would be able to finish 1.0 in 2 to 4\\nmonths \ud83d\ude05. The longer development cycle was a result of an increased scope and\\nlevel of quality that I came to expect for a proper 1.0 release. Over the course\\nof the year, I believe the project has risen to meet my expectations, and today\\nI\u2019m happy to announce the release of [version 1.0][version-1.0] of\\nrules_xcodeproj!\\n\\n[first-commit]: https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj/commit/0bb516569aee5dd49b004c89a761b5d186f25b15\\n[rules_xcodeproj]: https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj\\n[version-1.0]: https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj/releases/tag/1.0.1\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Screenshot of a rules_xcodeproj generated project open in Xcode\\" src=\\"/img/blog/rules_xcodeproj_screenshot.png\\" width=\\"1245\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n## The road to 1.0\\n\\nThe road to 1.0 has been an incredible journey. Early in the development cycle\\nSpotify, Robinhood, and Slack engineers became adopters and contributors;\\nwithout their help I wouldn\u2019t be writing this blog post today \ud83d\ude4f.\\n[JP](https://github.com/jpsim) became a vocal champion of rules_xcodeproj after\\nintegrating it with the SwiftLint and Envoy Mobile projects. During BazelCon\\n2022 the project got a couple shout-outs, including during\\n[Erik\u2019s wonderful talk](https://youtu.be/wy3Q38VJ5uQ?t=1209). And I\u2019m also\\nincredibly grateful that I was able to\\n[present rules_xcodeproj itself](https://youtu.be/B__SHnz3K3c) at the same\\nconference.\\n\\nDeciding what was _actually_ important for the 1.0 release shifted throughout\\nthe year. Some things that I initially thought were \u201cnice to haves\u201d, such as\\nframework targets and comprehensive ruleset support, became \u201cblockers\u201d for the\\nrelease. Other things that I was sure we would need before releasing, such as\\nmultiple Xcode configurations (e.g. `Debug`, `Profile`, and `Release`),\\ndiagnostic replaying, and BwX feature parity, ended up not being as important\\n(though don\u2019t worry if you are wanting some of those things, we aren\u2019t done\\nyet!).\\n\\nThe supported feature list also expanded throughout the year. It went from just\\nneeding to support the Core C/C++/Objective-C, [rules_swift][rules_swift], and\\n[rules_apple][rules_apple] rules, to supporting nearly any ruleset. Also,\\noutside contributors made their mark: [Chuck](https://github.com/cgrindel) added\\nsupport for custom Xcode schemes; [Chirag](https://github.com/chiragramani)\\nadded support for Runtime Sanitizers; [Maxwell](https://github.com/maxwellE)\\nadded support for Launch, Profile, and Test action environment variables and\\ncommand-line arguments; [Thi](https://github.com/thii) contributed BwB mode\\nspeed-ups and assisted with landing many more efficiency changes; and many\\nothers helped me test changes on their varied and complex projects. Overall\\nthese contributions, both in actual code and in invaluable time, allowed\\nrules_xcodepoj to be what it is today. Without this community effort the scope\\nand quality of the 1.0 release wouldn\u2019t be at the same level.\\n\\n[rules_apple]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple\\n[rules_swift]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nWhile the 1.0 release marks a certain level \u201cdoneness\u201d, there is still a lot we\\nwant to add and improve. When I\\n[announced rules_xcodeproj](meet-rules_xcodeproj.md), I listed a set of\\nrequirements that other projects didn\u2019t fulfill, and I stated that I wanted\\nrules_xcodeproj to cover all of them. I feel that with the 1.0 release we still\\nhave a little ways to go to fully cover those requirements; though some\\nwill have to be in spirit instead of to the letter, as Bazel and Xcode proved\\nto be more stubborn than I expected.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a list of changes that I hope we can implement in the near future:\\n\\n- An additional build mode, currently called \u201cBuild with Bazel via Proxy\u201d\\n  (BwBvP)\\n  - Uses [XCBBuildServiceProxyKit][xcbbuildserviceproxykit] to create an\\n    XCBBuildService proxy\\n  - Adds replaying of diagnostics, which removes duplicate errors/warnings,\\n    persists warnings, and enables Fix-Its\\n  - Produces a custom Build Report, removing noise from the logs, and fixing the\\n    progress bar\\n- BwB or BwBvP support for Xcode features that break with relative paths\\n  - Source code viewer in Instruments\\n  - Undefined Behavior Sanitizer navigation\\n  - Thread Performance Checker navigation\\n  - Memory Graph Analyzer with Malloc stack logging navigation\\n  - Inline code coverage\\n- Support for multiple Xcode configurations\\n\\n[xcbbuildserviceproxykit]: https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/XCBBuildServiceProxyKit\\n\\n## Thank you\\n\\nOnce again, I would like to thank all of the contributors and users we\u2019ve gained\\nthroughout the last year. Hopefully you are as proud of the 1.0 release as I am.\\nAnd for anyone reading that hasn\u2019t tried rules_xcodeproj yet, or it didn\u2019t meet\\nyour requirements in an earlier release, I invite you to give it a shot now.\\n\\nIf you run into any problems with rules_xcodeproj, please check if\\n[another issue already exists][issues] and comment on it, and if not,\\n[file an issue][file-an-issue]!

Buildbuddy has\\na [Trends](https://app.buildbuddy.io/trends/) page to visualize trends in this\\ndata over time.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/trends-2.png)\\n\\nThe trends page allows you to see how improvements you are making to your builds\\naffects your average build duration and other stats. It also exposes areas that\\nmight need improving. For example, if you see the cache hit rate go down over\\ntime, your build might have some non-deterministic build actions that could be\\nimproved, or some newly introduced dependencies that result in more frequent\\ncache invalidations.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhen we first created the Trends page, we used MySQL queries to aggregate\\nbuild stats and generate the data we wanted to display. For a time this worked\\nwell, but we quickly ran into performance issues for customers that had very\\nlarge numbers of builds. We were able to temporarily improve performance by\\nadding various indices, and though this helped to reduce the number of rows\\nread, it was not sufficient. Some customers do millions of builds monthly, and the\\nTrends page (which can look back up to a year) for these customers was taking\\nmore than 20 _minutes_ to load.\\n\\nThe queries behind the trends page require aggregation of multiple columns, such\\nas cache hits and cache misses. A traditional row-based database like MySQL is\\nnot always ideal for such a use case. In row-based databases, data is stored row\\nby row. When aggregating columns, more I/O seeks are required than\\na column-based database, which stores the data of each column in contiguous\\nblocks. Moreover, column-based databases have a higher compression rate because\\nconsecutive values of the same column are of the same type and may repeat.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/row-column-datastore.png)\\n\\nWith a row-based store, we can see from this diagram that computing a sum of\\ncache hit count would require us to load both block 1 and block 2. With\\na column-based store, all the cache hits data are stored in the same block.\\n\\nTherefore, we felt that using ClickHouse, a column-based database, would improve\\nthe performance of required queries for the trends page. We validated\\nClickHouse\u2019s performance against our use case: it took ClickHouse 0.317 seconds\\nto process 1.5 million rows and calculate the stats. The same query took MySQL\\nabout 24 minutes.\\n\\nOne of our goals for data migration is to make sure the data is accurate. We\\nadded monitoring and compared data between MySQL and ClickHouse after we enabled\\ndouble writing in production. One source of inconsistency was that data was\\ninserted into ClickHouse both by the backfill script and production servers.\\nDifferent to a traditional database, ClickHouse\u2019s\\n[ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree/)\\nengine only deduplicates data in the background at an indeterminate time. As\\na result, we needed to manually run the\\n[OPTIMIZE](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/optimize/)\\noperation to force ClickHouse to deduplicate data after the backfill was done.\\nAfter we were confident in the data consistency, we finally enabled the Trends\\npage to read from ClickHouse.\\n\\n## What\'s next\\n\\nWe are excited how ClickHouse unlocks more possibilities for us to provide\\nanalytical insights into builds, targets, tests and remote execution. For\\nexample, we want to add graphs that show how remote actions are spending most of\\ntheir time.

But by\\ndefault, Bazel uploads almost everything to the remote cache.\\n\\nIf your network is slow and your build artifacts are very large (like a\\ndocker image) this can lead to poor performance.\\n\\nTo address this, and make it easier to fix, we built the new cache\\nrequests card.\\n\\nIn this post we\'ll explore what insights this card can give you into your\\nbuilds, as well as some fun details about how the card works under the\\nhood.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New insights\\n\\nThe cache requests card lets you answer some interesting questions about\\nyour build which were not easily answerable before. Here are a few:\\n\\n_**My build seems to have uploaded a lot of data &mdash; which targets\\nuploaded the largest artifacts?**_\\n\\nTo answer this question, select \\"Sort by **Size**\\" and \\"Show **All**\\".\\nThen, select \\"Group by **None**\\". This will show the largest artifacts\\nfirst, with target names displayed in the leftmost column.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-card.png)\\n\\nWe can see in this screenshot that the largest cache transfer was a\\ndownload of an artifact from the external repository\\n`com_github_tuist_xcodeproj`. To see the full target and action name,\\nhover over the row.\\n\\n_**I see some file references in the build event stream which aren\'t\\nassociated with an action. What are these files?**_\\n\\nTo answer this question, select \\"Show **All**\\" and search for\\n**bes-upload**. You\'ll see all the files which were uploaded by Bazel\\nand not associated with an action, including the timing profile.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-card-bes-upload.png)\\n\\nThe build in this screenshot shows that a large artifact (285.9 MB) was\\nuploaded at the very end of the build, so it most likely was blocking the\\nbuild\'s completion. We can see the full artifact path by hovering over the\\nrow.\\n\\n_**I expected my build to be fully-cached, but it was not. Was there a\\nsingle action whose inputs or environment variables changed unexpectedly,\\nthus triggering all its dependent targets to be rebuilt?**_\\n\\nTo answer this question, make sure you are sorted by **start time** in\\nascending order, and take a look at the actions with the earliest\\ntimestamps. The earliest action is most likely the root cause of the\\nchange from the previous build.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-card-incremental-rebuild.png)\\n\\nBefore the build in this screenshot, a file in the\\n`priority_task_scheduler` target was edited, which we can see triggered a\\ncascade of action executions that transitively depended on\\n`priority_task_scheduler`.\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nImplementing the cache requests card required solving a few interesting\\nproblems.\\n\\nThe total size of the request metadata stored for each build is not\\nextremely large &mdash; just tens of megabytes for builds with hundreds of\\nthousands of cache requests &mdash; but we serve a high volume of\\nrequests, and we don\'t want to negatively impact cache performance just to\\nstore this metadata for each request.\\n\\nThe simplest solution to implement would be to do a blocking write to a\\nMySQL table for each cache request. This would also be pretty convenient\\nfor querying the data however we like. However, this would place far too\\nmuch load on the database and add way too much latency to each cache\\nrequest.\\n\\nSo, instead of using MySQL, we used Redis as an intermediate storage\\nmedium while the invocation is in progress. Redis can handle a much higher\\nvolume of writes than MySQL because it only stores values in memory and it\\nhas a much simpler key-value storage model.\\n\\nWe can\'t just store this data in Redis and call it a day, though. Firstly,\\nRedis does not give us long-term persistence, and it would be nice to be\\nable to keep this data around even for older invocations. To get long-term\\npersistence, we read all of the data from Redis and then serialize it into\\na [proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). We store this\\nproto into a \\"blobstore,\\" which is just a generic storage interface backed\\nby a local disk, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, etc.\\n\\nSecondly, even with the amazing performance of Redis, we can\'t just issue\\na single write request for every cache request. Doing a separate Redis\\nwrite for every request places a large amount of CPU load on Redis, since\\nit needs to do a `read()` and `write()` system call for each write.\\n(We learned this the hard way.)\\n\\nTo address this, we used Redis\\n[**pipelining**](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pipelining/). Instead of\\nissuing Redis commands directly, we add each command to a pipeline, and\\nhave a separate background job that periodically flushes the pipeline.\\nAdding the command to the pipeline is just a matter of appending to an\\nin-memory buffer, which takes just nanoseconds, so it doesn\'t impact cache\\nperformance to a significant degree.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-design-1.png)\\n\\nOnce an invocation is complete, we kick off a job to read all of the\\nrequests from Redis and then store it as a single blob in blobstore.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-design-2.png)\\n\\nTo read back this data for the UI, all we have to do is load this whole\\nblob into memory and then apply any client-side sorting and filtering.\\nThese blobs are small enough that we easily load the full blob into memory\\non the server &mdash; the blob is too big to be loaded in a browser,\\nthough, so we do use a relatively small page size.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/cache-requests-design-3.png)\\n\\n## What\'s next\\n\\nWe hope that you find the new cache requests card useful and that you\\nenjoyed reading about how it works!

In short, we provide a UI, distributed cache, and remote execution platform for your Bazel builds. That means we securely compile your code, cache the artifacts, and help you visualize the results. We make it possible to build projects like Tensorflow from your laptop in under 5 minutes instead of 90 minutes.\\n\\nObviously to do all this, we have to handle some thorny engineering challenges, one of which is scheduling remote executions. For that, we have a scheduler. The scheduler just matches actions (basically jobs) received by our API to remote workers that actually do the work. If you think of a full build of something like Tensorflow as a 10 course meal, a single action is like a recipe for a tiny part of that meal. To make it easier to visualize, here\'s a real action from building BuildBuddy:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n```bash\\n# this action just uses gcc to compile zlib/infback.c into an object file, zlib/infback.o\\n/usr/bin/gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -fstack-protector -Wall -Wunused-but-set-parameter \\\\\\n  -Wno-free-nonheap-object -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g0 -O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1 \\\\\\n  -DNDEBUG -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -MD -MF \\\\\\n  bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-34F00540/bin/external/zlib/_objs/zlib/infback.d \\\\\\n  -frandom-seed=bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-34F00540/bin/external/zlib/_objs/zlib/infback.o \\\\\\n  -iquote external/zlib -iquote bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-34F00540/bin/external/zlib \\\\\\n  -isystem external/zlib/zlib/include \\\\\\n  -isystem bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-34F00540/bin/external/zlib/zlib/include -g0 \\\\\\n  -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -fno-canonical-system-headers \\\\\\n  -Wno-builtin-macro-redefined -D__DATE__=\\"redacted\\" -D__TIMESTAMP__=\\"redacted\\" \\\\\\n  -D__TIME__=\\"redacted\\" -c external/zlib/infback.c -o \\\\\\n  bazel-out/k8-opt-exec-34F00540/bin/external/zlib/_objs/zlib/infback.o\\n```\\n\\nAnd here\'s another:\\n\\n```bash\\n# this action uses protobufjs to generate typescript bindings for a protobuf file\\nbazel-out/host/bin/external/npm/protobufjs/bin/pbts.sh\\n--out=bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/proto/buildbuddy_service_ts_proto.d.ts\\nbazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/proto/buildbuddy_service_ts_proto.js\\n--bazel_node_modules_manifest=bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/proto/__buildbuddy_service_ts_proto_pbts.module_mappings.json\\n```\\n\\nSo you get the idea, building a binary involves compiling and linking many different libraries etc and a single action is usually one of those commands. Great.\\n\\nSo let\'s say we have hundreds or thousands of these actions hitting our API at a time, and a pool of remote workers ready to run them. Let\'s get to it. If you\'re like me, your first thought here is _load balancer_. I mean, why not? These are just requests that need to get to a pool of machines, and load balancers are a really common, well understood way to do this.\\n\\nIn the very early days, this is what we did. We ran nginx in front of a pool of executors. And it kind of worked! But the results were... lumpy. In a typical web application, most requests served by load balancers are pretty homogeneous. They are static file lookups or simple page actions that all usually take under a second to serve. But our requests were very heterogenous: the fastest ones were simple gcc compile commands that generated a single object file and could finish in 10s of milliseconds. The slowest ones were gigantic slow link statements that required every single object file and took 30+ seconds to link. Or even worse, test actions that ran a unit test binary and took 30+ minutes to run.\\n\\nWhat happened is that the load balancer would assign tasks in a round robin fashion and put two large tasks on the same worker, while other workers were sitting there idle, and the build would take much longer than it should.\\n\\nI should mention that I really wanted this to work, because I didn\'t want to write a scheduler. It seemed complex and risky. I would much rather use something simple and well tested than build a custom critical piece of infrastructure like a scheduler. In fact I went through all kinds of machinations to avoid doing this, from using different load balancing techniques like least loaded or exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) to trying to split the work into multiple load balancer targets, to using the Kubernetes scheduler.\\n\\nAnd in the end, nothing worked well. The core reason a load balancer was such a poor fit here is that it didn\'t know the size of the requests it was routing. It seemed possible to give the load balancer some hints about this, but it would have meant writing our own load balancing algorithm, or relying on a very complex routing configuration. Neither option sounded appealing, and both negated my whole rationale for using a load balancer in the first place, namely that they are fast and easy.\\n\\nSo I went and did some reading about schedulers, and found this really lovely paper [https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2013/sosp_sparrow.pdf](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2013/sosp_sparrow.pdf) about a distributed scheduler called Sparrow. This paper is great because it\'s short and clearly written, and it talks about some cool ideas. The biggest idea is the power of two choices.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\n[The Power of Two Choices in Randomized Load Balancing](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/mythesis.pdf)\\n\\nIn a typical load balancer, some metrics are kept about how loaded a worker is based on how long it takes to serve a request, and then the load balancer uses those metrics to decide where to assign new requests. The metrics are stale though, being based on past requests, which leads to some non-optimal behavior. A better way to assign requests is just to pick two random workers and assign to the least loaded of the two. This leads to an exponential improvement in the maximum load.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nSparrow modifies two-choices slightly, and also introduces the idea of Late-Binding. In many schedulers, each worker maintains a queue and the scheduler tries to assign work to the worker with the shortest queue. The problem with this, and one of the core reasons it doesn\'t give good performance on our workloads, is that queue length is not a good indicator of how long a task will take. Late-binding solves this by enqueuing a task on multiple workers, and then the first worker to get to the task takes it. This effectively avoids the problems of huge single tasks blocking other work.\\n\\nAnother reason this paper is so great is because the authors actually implemented Sparrow, ported Apache Spark to use it, and then analyzed the results. Side note: I wish more papers were like this! So fun to read.\\n\\nSparrow is a _distributed_ scheduling algorithm, so no single node holds the entire state of the world. This is really important for us at BuildBuddy because we want our infrastructure to be resilient. When an API server or backend worker restarts or goes down, for whatever reason, we don\'t want it to impact customer builds.\\n\\nSo with this paper as a basis, I went and implemented Sparrow in Go, which was not nearly as hard as I\'d made it out to be. It maybe took a few days, which was far less time than I\'d spent trying to find alternative solutions. The lead author of the paper was even happy to help clarify things over email. And when I replaced our load balancer with it, the results were pretty much instantly far better than anything we\'d had before. No longer were builds timing out because of unequal load distribution. Even better, due to the distributed nature of the algorithm, we could run our workers on cheap preemptible compute machines that are often restarted and not worry about losing tasks. (These machines are less than half the cost!)\\n\\nWe still use this scheduler in production today, and it\'s working well for us. We\'ve made some modifications to the way requests are routed, but fundamentally this algorithm is the same one in the paper, the same one powering all remote execution on BuildBuddy today.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about BuildBuddy or try it, check out [our docs](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/introduction/).

with to go over the fundamentals of remote caching and remote execution,\\nwith a nuts and bolts\\n(or rather actions and spawns \ud83d\ude04)\\noverview of Bazel\'s remote capabilities.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Actions\\n\\nEach [rule target][rule] in the [build graph][build-graph] of a requested build produces zero or more [actions][action] during the [analysis phase][analysis-phase].\\nThese actions form an [action graph][action-graph],\\nrepresenting all the actions that need to be performed during the [execution phase][execution-phase].\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/action-graph.svg)\\n\\nDuring the execution phase the action graph is traversed.\\nFor each action,\\nBazel determines if it has to be executed,\\neither because the [action result][action-result] doesn\'t exist in the output base\'s [action cache][action-cache],\\nor because the output in the [output base][output-base] doesn\'t match the output listed in the action result.\\n\\n## Spawns\\n\\nIf Bazel has to execute an action,\\nit creates a [spawn][spawn],\\nwhich encodes all the information needed to be able to execute the action,\\nincluding the spawn\'s [\\"strategy\\"][spawn-strategy][^1],\\nwhich,\\namong other things,\\ndetermines if/how the spawn should utilize remote caching or remote execution.\\n\\n[^1]: Julio wrote a great [summary on spawn strategies](https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-strategies.html) that I highly recommend reading.\\n\\nA spawn\'s strategy will dictate if Bazel has to do additional work\\nbefore,\\nafter,\\nor instead of executing an action locally.\\nFor example,\\nif a spawn with the `remote-cache` strategy is executed,\\nBazel may check if the action result exists in the external cache\'s action cache,\\nand if it does,\\nit might download the listed outputs instead of executing the action.\\nI go over this in greater detail [later](#remote-caching).\\n\\nAfter an action\'s outputs are available in the output base,\\neither because they were downloaded or created locally,\\ndependent actions in the action graph can spawn.\\n\\n### Parallelism\\n\\n<a id=\\"local_cpu_resources-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe number of actions that can be executed locally at once is limited by the [`--local_cpu_resources`][local_cpu_resources] flag.\\nThe number of spawns that can be executed at once is limited by the [`--jobs`][jobs] flag.\\nSince a spawn\'s execution can include more work,\\nor different work,\\nthan an action\'s local execution,\\nit can be beneficial to have a `--jobs` value that is larger than `--local_cpu_resources`.\\nWhen that is the case,\\nand a spawn tries to execute an action locally,\\nit might block waiting for CPU resources to free up.\\nThis is where [remote execution](#remote-execution) can be beneficial.\\n\\n## Remote caching\\n\\nTo prevent confusion over Bazel\'s concept of a [\\"remote cache\\"][remote-caching],\\nwhich can mean either a disk cache which is local to the machine,\\nor a remote cache which uses networking protocols and is probably not local to the machine,\\nI\'m going to instead refer to both of these cache types as an \\"external cache\\",\\nas it\'s external to the output base.\\n\\nWhen using an external cache,\\nBazel will augment it\'s output base with the action cache (AC) and content-addressable storage (CAS) of the external cache.\\nThis means if an action result for an action that Bazel wants to execute isn\'t in the output base\'s action cache,\\nBazel can check if the AC has it.\\nThe same is true for the action\'s outputs;\\nif the output base doesn\'t have the expected output,\\nthen Bazel can check if the CAS has it.\\n\\n### `remote-cache`\\n\\nBazel achieves this behavior with the `remote-cache` spawn strategy,\\nwhich is used alongside a local strategy (e.g. `sandbox`, `worker`, `local`, etc.).\\n\\nA `remote-cache` spawn has the following steps:\\n\\n- If the action\'s action result isn\'t in the output base\'s action cache,\\n  try to retrieve it from the AC\\n  ([`ActionCache.GetActionResult`][reapi-getactionresult])[^2]\\n- If the action result was retrieved from either cache...\\n  - And the action\'s outputs are in the output base,\\n    the spawn is done\\n  - Otherwise,\\n    try to retrieve it from the CAS\\n    ([`ByteStream.Read`][bytestream-read])\\n- If the outputs were retrieved,\\n  the spawn is done\\n- Otherwise,\\n  the action is executed locally\\n- If the action completes successfully,\\n  the action\'s outputs are uploaded to the CAS\\n  ([`ByteStream.Write`][bytestream-write]),\\n  and its action result is uploaded to the AC\\n  ([`ActionCache.UpdateActionResult`][reapi-updateactionresult])[^3]\\n  - If [`--experimental_remote_cache_async`][experimental_remote_cache_async][^4] is used,\\n    then the spawn is done,\\n    and dependent actions are able to spawn\\n    while uploads continue in the background\\n  - Otherwise,\\n    uploads have to finish before dependent actions are able to spawn\\n\\n[^2]:\\n    Except possibly if [`--noremote_accept_cached`][remote_accept_cached] is set.\\n    See the [flags section](#flags).\\n\\n[^3]:\\n    Except if the action is tagged with `no-remote-cache-upload`,\\n

[`--disk_cache`][disk_cache] flag causes Bazel to use that directory on the filesystem as an external cache.\\nSetting the [`--remote_cache`][remote_cache] flag causes Bazel to connect via HTTP(S), gRPC(S), or UNIX sockets to an external cache.\\nSetting both flags causes Bazel to use both the disk cache and the remote cache at the same time,\\nforming a \\"combined cache\\".\\n\\nA combined cache reads from and writes to both the disk and remote caches,\\nand is treated like a remote cache overall,\\nunless the [`--incompatible_remote_results_ignore_disk`][incompatible_remote_results_ignore_disk] flag is used.\\nIf that flag is used,\\nthe disk cache instead continues to behave like a local cache,\\nallowing it to return results even if [`--noremote_accept_cached`][remote_accept_cached] is set,\\nstore results even if [`--noremote_upload_local_results`][remote_upload_local_results] is set,\\nand

[`--experimental_guard_against_concurrent_changes`][experimental_guard_against_concurrent_changes] flag helps protect the external cache from being poisoned by changes to input files that happen during a build.\\nI highly recommend setting this flag if developers have an external cache enabled,\\neven if it\'s only the disk cache.\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_instance_name-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nMost remote cache implementations will separate the AC,\\nand some will separate the CAS,\\nbased on the value of the [`--remote_instance_name`][remote_instance_name] flag.\\nThis can used for numerous reasons,\\nsuch as project separation,\\nor a bandage for non-hermetic toolchains.\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_cache_header-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--remote_cache_header`][remote_cache_header] flag causes Bazel to send extra headers in requests to the external cache.\\nMultiple headers can be passed by specifying the flag multiple times.\\nMultiple values for the same name will be converted to a comma-separated list.\\nThe [`--remote_header`][remote_header] flag can be used instead of setting both `--remote_cache_header` and `--remote_exec_header` to the same value.\\n\\n[^5]: Available in [Bazel 5.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/46c3f1711b90c648baf3d15d6df2890c8a12f67c).\\n\\n## Remote execution\\n\\nBazel is able to execute actions on a remote executor,\\ninstead of executing them locally,\\nusing a concept called [\\"remote execution\\"][remote-execution].\\nSince these actions don\'t use local resources,\\nthe number of actions that can be executed remotely in parallel is limited only by `--jobs` and the available remote resources,\\nnot `--local_cpu_resources`.\\nIf your builds are sufficiently parallel,\\nthis can result in them completing faster.\\nThe [parallelism section](#parallelism) goes into more detail.\\n\\n### `remote`\\n\\nBazel achieves the behavior of executing actions remotely with the `remote` spawn strategy,\\nwhich includes most of the behavior of the [`remote-cache`](#remote-cache) strategy,\\nand is used instead of a local strategy (e.g. `sandbox`, `worker`, `local`, etc.).\\n\\nA `remote` spawn has the following steps:\\n\\n- If the action\'s action result isn\'t in the output base\'s action cache,\\n  try to retrieve it from the AC\\n  ([`ActionCache.GetActionResult`][reapi-getactionresult])[^6]\\n- If the action result

([`ByteStream.Read`][bytestream-read])\\n- If the outputs were retrieved,\\n  the spawn is done\\n- Otherwise,\\n  determine if any inputs to the action need to be uploaded\\n  ([`ContentAddressableStorage.FindMissingBlobs`][reapi-findmissingblobs]),\\n  and upload them\\n  ([`ByteStream.Write`][bytestream-write])\\n- Then execute the action remotely

disk cache\\n(or more specifically,\\nthe combined cache)\\ncan be used with remote execution.\\nPrior to Bazel 5.0,\\nif you also wanted to cache things locally,\\nyou would have to setup a remote cache proxy sidecar.\\n\\n### Dynamic execution\\n\\nBazel supports a mode of remote execution called [\\"dynamic execution\\"][dynamic-execution],\\nin which local and remote execution of the same action are started in parallel,\\nusing the output from the first branch that finishes,\\nand cancelling the other branch.\\n\\nI wanted to mention it for completeness,\\nbecause when tuned properly it can result in faster builds than using either local execution or remote execution alone.\\nHowever,\\nit might not play well with [Remote Build without the Bytes](#remote-build-without-the-bytes),\\nas the local execution branches might need to download the outputs of previous remotely completed actions,\\nand if tuned improperly,\\nit can result in slower builds.\\n\\n### Flags\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_executor-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nSetting the [`--remote_executor`][remote_executor] flag causes Bazel to connect via gRPC(S) or UNIX sockets to a remote executor.\\nIf `--remote_cache` isn\'t set,\\nit defaults to the value set for `--remote_executor`.\\nMost remote execution setups will have the remote cache and remote executor at the same endpoint.\\n\\nIn addition to how it [affects the remote cache](#flags),\\nthe [`--remote_instance_name`][remote_instance_name] flag might determine which remote execution cluster a build runs on.\\nSome actions might need to target a specific subset of executors,\\npossibly because they need certain hardware or software,\\nand they can do that with [platform properties][platform-properties].\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_default_exec_properties-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nPlatform properties can be set globally with the [`--remote_default_exec_properties`][remote_default_exec_properties] flag,\\nbut only if they aren\'t set at the [platform][platform-exec_properties] or [target][target-exec_properties] level.\\nThe action result that is stored in an action cache includes the platform properties.\\nThis is important to note, as it can affect action cache hit rates.\\nIf you conditionally use remote execution,\\nand you use set platform properties,\\nyou might want to have them set non-conditionally,\\nin order to be able to reuse the cached action results.\\nSome remote execution implementations allow setting global platform properties with [`--remote_exec_header`](#remote_exec_header-flag) flags,\\nas a way to prevent these cache misses.\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_timeout-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--remote_timeout`][remote_timeout] flag controls how long Bazel will wait for a remote cache operation to complete.\\nWhile the timeout doesn\'t apply to the `Execution.Execute` call[^7],\\nusing remote execution might involve uploading or downloading artifacts that a local build doesn\'t,\\nand the default value for this flag\\n(60 seconds)\\nmight not be long enough.\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_retires-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--remote_retries`][remote_retries] flag controls how many times Bazel will retry a remote operation on a transient error,\\nsuch as a timeout.\\nThe flag defaults to `5`,\\nand depending on how you plan to use remote execution,\\nyou might want to increase it to a much larger value.\\nBazel uses an exponential backoff for retries,\\nbut currently caps the delay at 5 seconds between calls.\\n\\n<a id=\\"remote_exec_header-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--remote_exec_header`][remote_exec_header] flag causes Bazel to send extra headers in requests to the remote executor.\\nMultiple headers can be passed by specifying the flag multiple times.\\nMultiple values for the same name will be converted to a comma-separated list.\\nThe [`--remote_header`][remote_header] flag can be used instead of setting both `--remote_cache_header` and `--remote_exec_header` to the same value.\\n\\n[^7]:\\n    If the [`--experimental_remote_execution_keepalive`][experimental_remote_execution_keepalive] flag is set,\\n    the `Execution.Execute` and `Execution.WaitExecute` calls take into account the values of `--remote_timeout` and `--remote_retries`,\\n    but in a [more complicated way](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NgDPsCIwprDdqC1zj0qQrh5KGK2hQTSTux1DAvi4rSc).\\n    Even with that flag, the goal is for execution time to be unbounded,\\n    as it can vary greatly depending on the action being executed.\\n\\n## Remote Build without the Bytes\\n\\nFor both remote caching and remote execution,\\nBazel supports a feature called [\\"Remote Build without the Bytes\\"][remote-build-without-the-bytes] (BwtB).\\nIf enabled,\\nBazel will only download the direct outputs of the targets specified\\n([`--remote_download_toplevel`][remote_download_toplevel]),\\nor the minimum needed to complete the build\\n([`--remote_download_minimal`][remote_download_minimal]).\\nThis can result in greatly reduced network traffic,\\nwhich can also result in faster builds.\\n\\nThe feature isn\'t without its flaws though.\\nCurrently,\\nBwtB requires remote caches to [never evict outputs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8250),\\ncan result in slower builds due to clumping of downloads,\\ndoesn\'t allow specifying that other outputs should be downloaded,\\netc.\\nThough,\\nsimilar to [dynamic scheduling](#dynamic-scheduling),\\nif used properly BwtB can result in faster builds.\\nJust don\'t apply it blindly.\\n\\n## Bonus topic: Build Event Service\\n\\nBazel can stream build results,\\nspecifically the [build event protocol][bep] (BEP),\\nto a [build event service][bes] (BES).\\nDepending on the capabilities of the service,\\nthis can have numerous benefits.\\n\\nHere is a list of some benefits that various BES products (including BuildBuddy!) offer:\\n\\n- Easily share build logs\\n- See historical build data, including aggregations and trends\\n- See details not exposed via the terminal\\n  (e.g. all command-line flags used without having to use [`--announce_rc`][announce_rc],\\n  or all environment variables set)\\n- View action timing data (same as [`--experimental_generate_json_trace_profile`][experimental_generate_json_trace_profile])\\n- Visualize queries\\n- View error and test logs\\n- Download action outputs\\n- View remote cache stats\\n- View related remote execution data\\n  - List of actions executed\\n  - Individual action details\\n    (e.g. command-line arguments,\\n    environment variables,\\n    platform properties,\\n    timing data,\\n    and downloading inputs and outputs)\\n\\n### Flags\\n\\n<a id=\\"bes_backend-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nSetting the [`--bes_backend`][bes_backend] flag causes Bazel to connect via gRPC(S) to a BES backend and stream build results to it.\\nSetting the [`--bes_results_url`][bes_results_url] flag causes Bazel to output to the terminal a URL to the BES UI for the build underway.\\n\\nWhen using BES,\\nBazel will upload all files referenced in the BEP,\\nunless [`--experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=local`][experimental_build_event_upload_strategy][^8] is set.\\nAlternatively,\\nif you set [`--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache`][incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache][^9],\\nand have actions that are tagged with [`no-cache`/`no-remote-cache-upload`/`no-remote-cache`/`no-remote`][common-tags],\\nthen the output of those actions will still be excluded from upload.\\n\\n<a id=\\"bes_timeout-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--bes_timeout`][bes_timeout] flag controls how long Bazel will wait to finish uploading to BES after the build and tests have finished.\\nBy default there is no timeout,\\nwhich might not be what you want.\\nIf you leave the default,\\nyou should consider changing the [`--bes_upload_mode`][bes_upload_mode] flag,\\nwhich controls if Bazel should block the build for BES uploads\\n(the default),\\nor if it should finish the uploads in the background.\\n\\n<a id=\\"bes_header-flag\\"></a>\\n\\nThe [`--bes_header`][bes_header][^10] flag causes Bazel to send extra headers in requests to the BES backend.\\nIt behaves the same way as [`--remote_header`][remote_header].\\n\\n[^8]:\\n    A warning though:\\n    setting `--experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=local` will prevent the uploading of some nice things,\\n    such as the timing profile,\\n    or test logs.\\n\\n[^9]: Available in [Bazel

5.0","permalink":"/blog/whats-new-in-bazel-5-0"}},"content":"In our [last post][bazel_5_0],\\nwe summarized the changes that were in the Bazel 5.0 release.\\nThere were a lot of changes though,\\nso it can be hard to determine which ones are impactful to you and why.\\n\\nDon\'t worry, we\'ve got your back.\\nIn this post we highlight the changes that help BuildBuddy users build even faster!\\n\\n[bazel_5_0]: whats-new-in-bazel-5-0.md\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Build Event Service (BES) improvements\\n\\nBazel 5.0 includes many changes that make uploading BES events and artifacts to the BuildBuddy UI more reliable and performant.\\n\\nBefore Bazel 5.0,\\nif you wanted to upload a timing profile to BuildBuddy,\\nyou had to be fine with Bazel uploading all outputs referenced in the BEP,\\neven if they were set to not be cached\\n(e.g. the `--noremote_upload_local_results` flag or the `no-remote-cache` tag).\\nNow you can set the `--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache` flag,\\nwhich causes Bazel to respect your wishes in regards to output caching.\\n\\nAlso,\\nif you\'ve had [warnings][bes_upload_mode_warnings] or [crashes][bes_upload_mode_crashes] when using `--bes_upload_mode=fully_async` in the past,\\nthose should now be fixed as well.\\n\\n[bes_upload_mode_crashes]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11408\\n[bes_upload_mode_warnings]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11392\\n\\n## Deduplicated cache calls and uploads\\n\\nBefore Bazel 5.0,\\nwhen using Remote Build Execution (RBE),\\nBazel would ask the cache which blobs it needed to upload for every input to an action that was going to be executed remotely.[^1]\\nIt did this even if it had previously uploaded a specific input for a previous action.\\nSimilarly,\\nif two actions with similar inputs were executed concurrently,\\nthen Bazel didn\'t deduplicate the input existence checking or uploading.\\n\\nFor projects with a large number of shared inputs,\\nwhich is common in C-family programming languages and Node.js,\\nthis can cause a significant amount of network traffic,\\nresulting in long build times on low-bandwidth, high-latency connections.\\n\\nOn the output side of things,\\nif multiple actions produced the same output,\\nthen Bazel would upload the output multiple times.\\nIf these outputs were large,\\nthen this caused significant network overhead.\\n\\nBazel 5.0 addresses these issues.\\nIf you have a project that shares a lot of inputs between actions\\n(e.g. C, C++, Objective-C, and Node.js),\\nand you use BuildBuddy\'s Remote Execution,\\nthen Bazel 5.0 should improve your build times.\\n\\n[^1]:\\n    Specifically,\\n    Bazel would make a `FindMissingBlobs` that contained every input for an action,\\n    every time.\\n    Now Bazel will only include the unique inputs it hasn\'t already uploaded before.\\n\\n## Faster action cache checking\\n\\nIn a similar vein as the above mentioned issues,\\nBazel can be unnecessarily slow when checking if an action with a large number of inputs is cached.\\nThis is because Bazel needs to build a [Merkle tree][merkle_tree] from an action\'s inputs,\\nwhich can be expensive if there are many.\\n\\nStarting in Bazel 5.0,\\nyou can use the `--experimental_remote_merkle_tree_cache` and `--experimental_remote_merkle_tree_cache_size` flags to cache the nodes of these merkle trees.\\nIf you have a project that shares a lot of it\'s inputs between actions\\n(e.g. C, C++, Objective-C, and Node.js),\\nand you use BuildBuddy\'s Remote Cache or Remote Execution,\\nthen these flags should improve your build times.\\n\\n[merkle_tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree\\n\\n## Asynchronous cache uploading\\n\\nWhen an action is run locally,\\nand Bazel uploads the action\'s outputs to a remote build cache,\\nit waits for that upload to complete before it executes dependent actions.\\nThis is needed for dependent actions that are executed remotely,\\nbut it\'s unnecessary if they are executed locally.\\nThese delays can cause builds that use BuildBuddy\'s Remote Cache to sometimes be slower than if they didn\'t use the cache.\\n\\nStarting in Bazel 5.0,\\nyou can use the `--experimental_remote_cache_async` flag to have Bazel perform these uploads asynchronously.\\nUploads still need to complete before a build finishes,\\nbut now Bazel can speed ahead with local execution regardless of upload speed.\\nNetwork utilization is also improved,\\nas uploads can queue up quicker.\\nIf you have a project that uploads to BuildBuddy\'s Remote Cache,\\nthen this flag should improve your build times.\\n\\n## Compressed uploads and downloads\\n\\nBazel 5.0 added the `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` flag,\\nwhich causes Bazel to compresses and decompress artifact uploads and downloads with the [zstd algorithm][zstd].\\nIn our testing this reduces the average number of bytes transferred by 60-70%.\\n\\nThere is some overhead involved in this,\\nboth on the Bazel side and the cache side,\\nso it won\'t make every build for every project faster.[^2]\\nThat said,\\nif network bandwidth is a bottleneck in your build times,\\nthis flag could make those builds significantly faster.\\n\\n[zstd]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstandard\\n\\n[^2]:\\n    Eventually we might store artifacts in their compressed state,\\n    removing most overhead on the cache side.\\n\\n## And more...\\n\\nBazel 5.0 includes many additional changes that improve it\'s reliability and performance.\\nTo dig a little deeper,\\nbe sure to check out our [What\'s New in Bazel 5.0][bazel_5_0]

execution][remote-explained].\\nNumerous improvements and fixes to Bazel\'s remote capabilities are included in Bazel 5.0.\\n\\n[remote-explained]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md\\n\\n### gRPC\\n\\nBazel uses gRPC as a protocol for most of its remote capabilities.\\nThere were a couple changes that applied at this foundational level:\\n\\n- Added mnemonic and label to remote cache and remote execution requests. ([a750a56](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f8f4061516ec3056ae8a8295ea8279903))\\n- Bazel no longer crashes on errors returned while creating a gRPC connection. ([b0ae0af](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d451bbe374be24c905579cece793b90c7))\\n\\n### Remote caching (RBC)\\n\\nUsing a remote cache is one of the most popular ways of speeding up a Bazel build.\\nThankfully these changes make using a remote cache both more performant and more reliable:\\n\\n- Added the `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` flag, which compresses gRPC uploads/downloads. ([50274a9](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f714616d4735a560db7f617e53fb8d01b))\\n- Added the `--experimental_remote_cache_async` flag, which makes uploads happen in the background.

([4e29042](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/fd77eae565a711655df6150500cb6e915))\\n- Added the `no-remote-cache-upload` tag, which allows downloading, but not uploading, outputs from the remote cache. ([bfc2413](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9d93f8643686d91596ba347df2e01966a))\\n- Reduced `FindMissingBlobs` calls when using a combined cache.

([fa118ae](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4b5d58648db574a08a60d5595d6b645dd))\\n- `label_keyed_string_dict` attributes are now considered when gathering instrumented files for coverage. ([9015f38](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3220892b638d47257ddbd407b2ea07055))\\n- Changed `DEFAULT_STUB_SHEBANG` to use python3 instead of python. ([2945ef5](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/072f659878dfd88b421c7b80aa4fb6c80))\\n- Added the default `solib` dir to the `rpath` for shared libs with transitions. ([20061f8](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/fb7ed95924c6cdbaaaf3d06a64edf974e))\\n- Removed `//visibility:legacy_public`. ([0803ce4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/cbeb209689bb97f1b5107383ca201e2b6))\\n- Removed `--action_graph` from the dump command. ([7cf0c34](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9b2e1675deea9519be4a805d8daff732e))\\n- Added some fixes for the Starlark transition hash computation.

We\'re excited to share that **v2.7.0** of BuildBuddy is live on both [Cloud Hosted BuildBuddy](https://app.buildbuddy.io/) and open-source via [Github](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy), [Docker](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/docs/on-prem.md#docker-image), and [our Helm Charts](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm)!\\n\\nWe\'ve also updated [the list of open source repositories that use BuildBuddy](https://www.buildbuddy.io/open-source-repos). If you have an open source repo that\'s using BuildBuddy, and would like to be included on the list - please fill out the quick form at the bottom of that page!\\n\\nThanks to everyone using open source, cloud-hosted, and enterprise BuildBuddy. We\'ve made lots of improvements in this release based on your feedback.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New in v2.7.0\\n\\n- **M1 Mac support** - we now [publish](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/releases/tag/v2.7.0) BuildBuddy executor binaries built for M1 Macs. These can be used with BuildBuddy Cloud\'s **Bring Your Own Executors** feature, BuildBuddy managed Mac executors, or in a self-hosted RBE cluster.\\n\\n- **Build log improvements** - the build log viewer is core to the BuildBuddy experience. We\'ve made a ton of improvements in this release to make this log viewing experience even better. Build logs are now **live** and update much more frequently. You can also now **search** build logs with a built-in search bar, **download** the raw build log text, and even **wrap** long lines.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/build_logs.png)\\n\\n- **Cache miss debugging UI** - one of the requests we get most frequently is for help debugging remote cache misses. There\'s a [guide](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/remote-execution-caching-debug.html) in the Bazel documentation, but it can be cumbersome to follow. We\'ve made this process easier by surfacing individual action cache misses directly on the BuildBuddy cache tab. This allows you to quickly dive into which targets and actions missed cache and compare them against previous builds. You can click on any of these action hashes to explore the action\'s input files, environment variables, and command arguments. This is just the first step in making cache misses easier to debug - we\'re working on making this process even easier.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/cache_misses.png)\\n\\n- **Member management & roles** - we\'ve heard from many of the large organizations that we work with that they\'d like to be able to limit which members of their organization are able to access certain BuildBuddy functionality - like editing organization settings. In order to support this, we\'ve added a new member management UI on the BuildBuddy organization settings page. Here you can assign either `Admin` or `Developer` roles to members of your BuildBuddy organization.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/members.png)\\n\\n- **Usage page** - while our Trends page gives users great insight into how their build metrics are trending over time, it\'s less useful for getting a sense of your total BuildBuddy usage for the current month (and previous months). We\'ve introduced a new Usage page that allows you to get a quick glance of the metrics that are important for billing.\\n  ![](../static/img/blog/usage.png)\\n\\n- **And much much more** - Every release comes packed with so many new features, performance improvements and bug fixes that we can\'t get to them all. Here are some more highlights:\\n  - Mac support for remote persistent workers\\n  - API improvements, including a build log download endpoint and target filtering by tag\\n  - Fixes for issues that can cause unnecessary BEP disconnects\\n  - Improvements to autoscaling scale-downs\\n  - Reduced memory footprint\\n  - New BEP live data export functionality\\n  - Flag overrides for platform properties for switching between pools without invalidating the cache\\n  - SAML quality of life improvements\\n  - Configurable executor docker image warm up\\n  - Support for Azure Storage as a storage backend\\n  - AWS WebIdentity authentication support\\n  - Private container registry support\\n  - A built-in Xcode locator in executors for discovering available Xcode versions\\n\\n## Coming soon!\\n\\nIn addition to all of these great new features, we\'ve also been laying the groundwork for some big new features that we\'re working on:\\n\\n- A new caching infrastructure that will enable far more flexibility in where and how cache artifacts are stored.\\n- Mac support for [BuildBuddy Workflows](https://blog.buildbuddy.io/blog/meet-buildbuddy-workflows/).\\n- A managed cloud Bazel service that uses [Firecracker microVMs](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) to give you warm, incremental Bazel instances in the cloud (right next to your RBE cluster) that spin up in milliseconds.\\n- A web-based code editor built on top of VSCode (similar to [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/)) built entirely for Bazel that can kick off fully incremental RBE-enabled cloud Bazel builds & tests. If you\'re an ex-Googler who misses Cider &mdash; get excited!\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in any of these upcoming features and would like to try them out &mdash; [sign up here for early access](https://buildbuddy.typeform.com/to/BZikT3Eu)!\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.

The date picker allows you to select a time range and see builds, trends, etc. for exactly the time period you\'re interested in.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/date_picker.png)\\n\\n- **Clickable trends** - Now that you can filter any view by date, we\'ve added a feature to the Trends page that allows you to click on a data point and be taken to a filtered view of builds from just that time period. As part of this change, the trends page now also respects your local time zone.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/trends.png)\\n\\n- **Branch information** - BuildBuddy now collects information about a build\'s git branch in addition to the repo and commit info already collected. This makes it even easier to navigate your builds.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/branch.png)\\n\\n- **Light terminal theme** - For those of you who suffer from eye strain when reading light text on dark backgrounds: we\'ve heard your feedback. We\'ve added a new light terminal theme that can be enabled in your personal settings.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/light_terminal.png)\\n\\n- **Improved flaky test support** - Flaky tests can destroy developer productivity. To make them easier to deal with, we\'ve added a new feature that calls out flaky tests & timeouts more explicitly. We\'ve also improved the behavior of our RBE to reduce flakes due to timeouts when caused by external factors like Docker image pulls.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/flaky_test.png)\\n\\n- **Remote executions tab** - We\'ve had a hidden feature for a while that allowed you to click on the `Remote execution on` label to see an overview of remotely executed actions for RBE builds. We\'ve now promoted this feature to its own `Executions` tab. With this change come new features like search and filtering.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/executions_tab.png)\\n\\n- **Action input & output files** - When clicking on an individual remotely executed actions, we now have a new file viewer that allows you to navigate the input files of the action. You can click on any of these files (as well as any output files the action has) to download them from the remote cache.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/file_tree.png)\\n\\n- **Action timing** - The timing tab gives you a breakdown of execution timing from Bazel\'s point of view, but there\'s another story to tell from the remote executor\'s point of view. Action pages now show a visual breakdown of time spent in queue, downloading inputs, executing, and uploading outputs for each remotely executed action.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/action_timeline.png)\\n\\n- **Revamped settings page** - We\'ve revamped the settings page to make it easier to manage your BuildBuddy account.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/settings.png)\\n\\n- **And much much more** - Every release comes packed with so many new features, performance improvements and bug fixes that we can\'t get to them all. Here are some more highlights:\\n  - Support for serving static files from a CDN\\n  - Support for MinIO as a storage backend\\n  - Buildkite links now link to the specific Buildkite job that spawned the invocation\\n  - Support for distributed tracing backends like Jaeger, Google Cloud Trace, and others\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release. Stay tuned for more updates coming soon!\\n\\nAs always, we love your feedback - join our [Slack channel](https://community.buildbuddy.io) or email us at <hello@buildbuddy.io> with any questions, comments, or thoughts."},{"id":"meet-buildbuddy-workflows","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/meet-buildbuddy-workflows","editUrl":"https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/edit/master/website/blog/meet-buildbuddy-workflows.md","source":"@site/blog/meet-buildbuddy-workflows.md","title":"Meet BuildBuddy Workflows","description":"In today\'s BuildBuddy v2.3 release, which is now live on BuildBuddy Cloud, we\'re launching BuildBuddy Workflows.

BuildBuddy Workflows is a Continuous Integration (CI) solution for Bazel repositories hosted on GitHub (with support for other providers coming soon).\\n\\nLike other CI solutions, Workflows give you the confidence that your code\\nbuilds successfully and passes all tests before you merge pull requests or\\ndeploy a new release.\\n\\nBut because BuildBuddy Workflows were built for Bazel repos and tightly\\nintegrated with BuildBuddy RBE and Remote Caching, they are **_really fast_**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n# Why a Bazel-focused CI solution?\\n\\nTraditional [CI systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), like Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI, and BuildKite, are built around the concept of a pipeline. Pipelines allow you to specify a list of build/test steps to run for each commit or pull request to your repo. Pipelines are great because you can run many in parallel across multiple machines. Unfortunately, there are often dependencies between these pipelines, for example a build step that must be completed before a test step can begin.\\n\\nSome tools, like [GitLab Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/), attempt to solve this problem by allowing you to specify dependencies between pipelines. This approach is better, but forces you to manually maintain the relationships between pipelines in a pile of YAML configuration files. As the number of dependencies grow, any sufficiently complex CI system [starts to resemble a build system](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/07/modern-ci-is-too-complex-and-misdirected/).\\n\\nNone of these pipeline-based approaches are well suited for Bazel\'s approach to dependency management and remote build execution, which involves generating a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of all build and test actions. Bazel\'s approach allows for optimal parallelization and caching of these actions. It also enables rebuilding and retesting only affected targets, saving both engineering time and compute resources.\\n\\n## How fast are BuildBuddy Workflows?\\n\\nWe\'ve used BuildBuddy Workflows on our own repos for the past few\\nmonths, comparing them side-by-side with our existing CI solution built on GitHub Actions with BuildBuddy RBE and Remote Caching enabled.\\n\\nBy leveraging warm, hosted, Bazel processes, as well as BuildBuddy\'s\\nremote caching and execution, Workflows dramatically sped up our CI runs.\\nCompared to our previous solution (which used BuildBuddy RBE and Remote Caching on GitHub Runners), we reduced the median duration by nearly **8X** &mdash; with most CI runs completing in just a few seconds.\\n\\nThis overlapping histogram chart shows the complete picture. Note that\\nthe majority of BuildBuddy workflow runs took 30 seconds or less, while\\nnearly all runs on GitHub Actions took at least 2 minutes and 15 seconds:\\n\\n![overlapping histogram comparing BuildBuddy and GitHub actions](../static/img/blog/workflows.png)\\n\\n## How did we make BuildBuddy Workflows so fast?\\n\\nIn addition to convenience and security, one of our main goals for Workflows\\nwas to maximize performance, even for very large source repositories.\\n\\nWe did this in two main ways:\\n\\n1. Ensuring a **fast network connection between Bazel and BuildBuddy\'s RBE & caching servers**.\\n2. Running workflows against **hosted, warm, Bazel instances**.\\n\\n### Fast connection to BuildBuddy RBE\\n\\nIn our experience, network latency is often the biggest bottleneck in many Bazel Remote Build Execution and Remote Caching setups.\\n\\nThe solution here was simple: run Workflows on executors in the same datacenters where BuildBuddy RBE and Cache nodes are deployed.\\n\\nWith GitHub actions or other CI solutions, the network connection might\\nbe fast (particularly after the recent network optimizations we made in\\n[BuildBuddy v2](/blog/introducing-buildbuddy-v2)) &mdash; but not nearly as fast\\nas having workflow runners on the same local network as BuildBuddy\\nitself.\\n\\n### Hosted, Warm, Bazel instances\\n\\nOnce you have a sufficiently fast RBE and Remote Caching setup, and have removed network bottlenecks &mdash; the CI bottleneck often becomes Bazel\'s [analysis phase](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/glossary.html#analysis-phase).\\n\\nBy re-using warm Bazel processes when possible, we\'re able to re-use Bazel\'s analysis cache across CI runs of the same repo. This can save several minutes per build, depending on the size of your repository and the number of external dependencies being pulled in.\\n\\nThis is similar to how [Google\'s Build Dequeuing Service](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3395363.3397371) performs workspace selection:\\n\\n> A well-chosen workspace can increase the build speed by an\\n> order of magnitude by reusing the various cached results from the\\n> previous execution. [...] We have observed that builds that execute the same targets as a previous\\n> build are effectively no-ops using this technique\\n\\n## How do I use BuildBuddy Workflows?\\n\\nBuildBuddy Workflows are launching today, in Beta, for all GitHub users. You can get started with BuildBuddy Workflows by checking out our [setup guide](https://docs.buildbuddy.io/docs/workflows-setup/).\\nIf you\'ve already linked your GitHub account to BuildBuddy, it\'ll only take\\nabout 30 seconds to enable Workflows for your repo &mdash; just select a repo\\nto link, and we\'ll take care of the rest!\\n\\n## Other changes in BuildBuddy v2.3\\n\\nWhile the main focus of BuildBuddy v2.3 has been on launching BuildBuddy Workflows, the release also contains several other features, in addition to lots of bug fixes and performance improvements.\\n\\n### Dependency graph visualization\\n\\nWe added dependency graph visualizations for `bazel query` commands that use the `--output graph` parameter. This visualization is zoom-able and pan-able, and can render graphs with thousands of edges.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of a command you can run to generate a graph:\\n\\n```shell\\nbazel query \'//...\' --output graph --bes_backend=remote.buildbuddy.io --bes_results_url=https://app.buildbuddy.io/invocation/\\n```\\n\\nAnd the resulting output:\\n\\n![Bazel query dependency graph visualization](../static/img/blog/query_graph.png)\\n\\n### Clickable RBE Actions\\n\\nFor actions executed with BuildBuddy Remote Build Execution, you can now click on individual actions to get the full set of command arguments, environment variables, execution metadata, output files, and more:\\n\\n![RBE actions view](../static/img/blog/clickable_rbe_actions.png)\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release!

When we released the [first version](https://blog.buildbuddy.io/blog/meet-buildbuddy) of BuildBuddy a little over a year ago, we were blown away by the demand for tools and techniques for speeding up common developer workflows like building, testing, and debugging code. We\'ve been working hard ever since - using our own tools to build the next generation of developer tooling for all.\\n\\nToday we\'re excited to announce v2 of BuildBuddy! We\'ve completely revamped our caching and remote build execution infrastructure to give our users and customers the one thing they care about above all else: **speed**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/tensorflow.svg)\\n\\nWhen optimizing the performance of a remote build execution system, there are 3 critical bottlenecks: Caching, Sandboxing, and Execution. We\'ve made order of magnitude improvements in each of these areas, bringing clean, uncached build times for [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) (7,000+ actions) on BuildBuddy RBE down from 28 minutes last August to just **3.47 minutes** with BuildBuddy v2. This build takes over **4 hours** (250 min) on a 3.3GHz i7 Macbook Pro.\\n\\n## Caching\\n\\nThe biggest remote build execution bottleneck is right in the name: **remote**. This means we have to ship source files, tools, and other inputs needed to execute the build from the host machine to a remote cluster of build servers over the network.\\n\\nIn BuildBuddy v2, some of the many improvements in this area include:\\n\\n- Completely revamped caching infrastructure for microsecond read/write latencies\\n- Improved batch performance for quickly moving 100k+ small files\\n- Load balancer optimizations to improve large file throughput\\n\\nFor a more in-depth look at optimizing for high throughput and low latency, we highly recommend [this great article from the Dropbox Engineering team](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/optimizing-web-servers-for-high-throughput-and-low-latency) which was incredibly helpful in identifying and fixing bottlenecks.\\n\\nAll of these improvements, when taken together, have driven a colossal improvement in both upload and download throughput across file sizes. We have more work to do in this area, but we\'re really pleased with the results in this release.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/upload_throughput.svg)\\n\\n## Sandboxing\\n\\nOnce we\'ve got all of the inputs we need to execute an action on a remote executor, the next step is to set up the execution root. One of Bazel\'s core features is the ability to perform [hermetic builds](https://georgi.hristozov.net/2020/11/01/the-power-of-hermetic-builds). In order to achieve this, we spin up a clean Docker container for each action to execute in. This is similar to Bazel\'s `docker` [spawn strategy](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution-sandbox.html).\\n\\nWhile this helps ensure that remotely executed actions are hermetic, there is often a trade-off between hermeticity and performance. You can make this trade-off locally using Bazel\'s different spawn strategies: `sandboxed`, `local`, and `worker`.\\n\\nWhen using remote build execution, you typically don\'t have the ability to make these trade-offs. That\'s why we\'ve introduced 3 new features that give users back some of that control. By default, actions will still be executed in clean Docker images - but if you specify one of the following execution properties, you can alter that behavior:\\n\\n- `recycle-runner`: actions will still be executed in a clean execution root - but the executor will re-use an existing docker image from a pool of re-usable containers. This is similar in behavior to Bazel\'s `sandboxed` execution strategy.\\n- `preserve-workspace`: actions will re-use an execution root from a pool of re-usable workspaces and only download inputs that have been added or changed since the previously executed action, while cleaning up any outputs. This is similar in behavior to Bazel\'s `local` execution strategy.\\n- `persistent-workers`: the executor will use the [persistent-worker](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/persistent-workers.html) protocol to communicate with actions that support them. This can help speed up certain build actions that support persist workers (like Java, Scala, Typescript, and others) by 2-4x. This execution property can be applied at the [target level](https://docs.buildbuddy.io/docs/rbe-pools#target-level) for actions that support them. We\'ve also added support for the proposed `persistentWorkerKey` execution property which removes the need for target-level specification. This is similar in behavior to Bazel\'s `worker` execution strategy.\\n\\n## Execution\\n\\nNow that we\'ve got our inputs on the executor, and our execution root set up, our final step is the actual execution.\\n\\nWe\'ve made significant improvements here as well:\\n\\n- We\'ve upgraded our default executor cluster to run on compute-optimized Intel Cascade Lake machines with up to 3.8 GHz sustained all-core turbo.\\n- Our Mac executors now run on bare-metal Mac minis, which show huge improvements over the previous [Orka](https://www.macstadium.com/orka) machines we used for I/O intensive workloads.\\n- Our new caching and auto-scaling infrastructure supports scaling up and down from just a few executors to hundreds of machines depending on load while still supporting the `--remote_download_minimal` flag.\\n- The groundwork has been laid for what we call **Bring Your Own Executors**. This will allow users to take advantage of BuildBuddy\'s UI and global caching infrastructure while running their own executor pools.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/autoscaling.png)\\n\\n## Other improvements\\n\\nWhile our focus for v2 has been on RBE performance, we\'ve made plenty of other improvements in this release:\\n\\n- Improved query performance for large customers with 1 million+ invocations\\n- Added hinted handoff for write failures\\n- Fetches are now displayed in the results UI\\n- Timing tab improvements\\n- Right click to copy downloadable artifact URLs\\n- Lots and lots of reliability improvements\\n- Default Xcode version configuration options\\n\\nWe have several big announcements coming in the next few weeks, so stay tuned for more!\\n\\nAs always, we love your feedback - join our [Slack channel](https://community.buildbuddy.io) or email us at <hello@buildbuddy.io> with any questions, comments, or thoughts.\\n\\nHappy Building!"},{"id":"buildbuddy-achieves-soc-2-certification","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/buildbuddy-achieves-soc-2-certification","editUrl":"https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/edit/master/website/blog/buildBuddy-achieves-soc-2-certification.md","source":"@site/blog/buildBuddy-achieves-soc-2-certification.md","title":"BuildBuddy Achieves SOC 2 Certification","description":"Our mission at BuildBuddy is to help developers be more productive.

While Bazel has some flags to control cache writes, using these can be error prone and insecure. BuildBuddy now makes this easy by introducing the ability to create both read-only and read+write api keys on your organization settings page. You can create as many API keys (and certificates) as you\'d like and distribute them to your CI machines, workstations, and other endpoints.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/read-only.png)\\n\\n- **Improved docs** - we\'ve completely revamped [our documentation](https://docs.buildbuddy.io/) and added support for tables of contents, syntax highlighting, better navigation, dark mode (!!), interactive widgets, and an \\"Edit this page\\" button that links directly to the correct file in our [GitHub docs directory](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/tree/master/docs) for submitting pull requests. With these great new features, we\'ll be ramping up documentation on both new and existing BuildBuddy features to make the lives of BuildBuddy users easier.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/docsv2.png)\\n\\n- **Testing improvements** - we\'ve invested heavily in our testing infrastructure, adding new integration tests and test fixtures that make testing BuildBuddy\'s interactions with Bazel easier. This will lead to more stable releases and faster iteration cycles going forward.\\n\\n- **Remote execution improvements** - we\'ve made more speed and reliability improvements to our remote build execution platform, including faster cache hit checking, faster auth checks, and better support for iOS builds.\\n\\n- **Buildkite integration -** invocations that are kicked off from Buildkite now link back to the Buildkite job that triggered them.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/buildkite.png)\\n\\n- **Grafana** - our [Helm charts](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm) make deploying BuildBuddy to Kubernetess cluster a breeze. One thing that\'s been tricky for many users has been accessing the Prometheus data that BuildBuddy exports in an easily digestible format. To fix this, we made it easy to [deploy Grafana and Prometheus](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm/tree/master/charts/buildbuddy-enterprise#example-with-prometheus--grafana) via our Helm charts with just a couple lines of configuration. It comes out of the box with a default dashboard that shows popular BuildBuddy metrics and can be easily extended to add more graphs.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/grafana.png)\\n\\n- **More to come** - we\'ve been laying the groundwork for two major projects that will go live in the coming weeks to make building and testing your Bazel projects even faster.\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.

We\'ve made lots of improvements in this release based on your feedback.\\n\\nA special thank you to our new open-source contributor:\\n\\n- [**Corbin McNeely-Smith**](https://github.com/restingbull) who contributed to making our auth flow more resilient to error cases, and made our health-check handlers more flexible to support different load-balancers.\\n\\nOur focus for this release was on giving users more visibility into test flakiness, monitoring & scaling improvements, and security hardening.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New in v1.5.0\\n\\n- **Test flakiness dashboard** - one of the feature requests we get most frequently from BuildBuddy users is the ability to collect target-level data and analyze it across invocations. Today we\'re taking the first step in the direction with our new test dashboard. The test dashboard allows you to monitor per-target test statuses by commit - so you can quickly identify and fix flaky test targets that slow down developer velocity. It also has a timing view that gives you a heat-map to quickly identify slow targets. This is just the first step we\'re taking in exposing more target-level data and are excited to build additional features based on your feedback!\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/test-grid.png)\\n\\n- **Prometheus metrics** - we\'ve added a ton of new Prometheus metrics to BuildBuddy that allow open-source and Enterprise users to monitor not only BuildBuddy\'s performance, but the overall health of their developer productivity efforts. This allows you to hook into existing monitoring and alerting tools like Grafana to analyze and get notified when your developers are experiencing issues. Metrics include build duration, cache hit & miss rates, remote execution queue length, and more. For a full list of the new metrics we now expose, see our [Prometheus metric documentation](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/prometheus-metrics). Interested in some metrics that aren\'t on this list? Let us know!\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/prometheus.png)\\n\\n- **Auto-scaling** - with the addition of our new Prometheus metrics, we\'ve also made improvements to the autoscaling capabilities of BuildBuddy executors. Now in addition to scaling off of raw compute metrics like CPU\xa0and RAM, BuildBuddy executors can also be configured to scale based on executor queue length and other custom metrics. This allows you to achieve better performance under heavy load while also managing your compute resources more efficiently and cost-effectively.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/autoscaling-prometheus.png)\\n\\n- **Security hardening** - as part of our SOC 2 compliance controls, BuildBuddy undergoes regularly scheduled penetration tests by paid security professionals. This release contains fixes for all three non-critical findings from our January 2021 pen-test.\\n\\n- **Memory leak fixes** - we found and fixed 2 memory leaks in our BuildBuddy app (using our new Prometheus metrics!) that would occasionally cause BuildBuddy app servers to restart due to memory pressure.\\n\\n- **Mac executor bug fix** - we fixed a tricky bug caused by quirks in the way macOS handles hard-linking that significantly improves the reliability of our Mac RBE executors.\\n\\n- **More bug fixes** - there are lots of other bug fixes in this release including improved deadline and timeout handling, executor task scheduling improvements, and more!\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.

At BuildBuddy we\'re firmly committed to open source and believe that a transparent and open model is the only way to build truly great developer infrastructure for all.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New to Open Source BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Invocation sharing & visibility controls** - while you\'ve always been able to share BuildBuddy links with members of your organization, it\'s been difficult to share invocations more broadly (in GitHub issues or on StackOverflow). Now that working from home is the new norm, sharing links to your build logs or invocations details and artifacts has become more important than ever. To support this, we\'ve added a **Share** button on the invocation page that allows you to control visibility of your invocations (this can be disabled at the organization level). We\'ve also disabled the expiration of invocations and build logs for everyone on BuildBuddy Cloud - so you can share BuildBuddy links with confidence.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/share.png)\\n\\n- **Invocation diffing** - we\'ve all run into the problem where a build works on your machine, but not on your coworker\'s machine. To support debugging these kinds of issues, we\'ve added the ability to diff builds straight from the invocations page. This allows you to quickly find any flags or invocation details that may have changed between builds. Stay tuned for more diffing features here, including cache hit debugging and more.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/compare.png)\\n\\n- **Suggested fixes** - as software engineers, we often find ourselves bumping into errors and issues that many others have bumped into before. A tool like BuildBuddy provides the perfect way to quickly surface these suggested fixes to developers quickly, without even so much as a Google search. We\'ve started by adding suggestions for common issues that BuildBuddy users run into, but stay tuned for the ability to add your own custom fix suggestions and share them with your organization and beyond!\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/suggested-fixes.png)\\n\\n- **Easy invocation deletion** - you can now delete your BuildBuddy invocations directly from the invocation page \\"three dot\\" menu in case you want to share an invocation and delete it when you\'re done.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/deletion.png)\\n\\n## New to Cloud & Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Cache stats & filters** - our trends page now allows you to see trends in caching performance broken down by the Action Cache (AC) and the Content Addressable Store (CAS). The trends page is now also filterable by CI vs non-CI builds, and by user, repo, commit, or host.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/filtered-trends.png)\\n\\n- **Simplified API key header auth** - previously if you wanted to authenticate your BuildBuddy invocations using an API key (instead of using certificated based mTLS), you had to place your API key in each BuildBuddy flag that connected to BuildBuddy with `YOUR_API_KEY@cloud.buildbuddy.io`. This has been greatly simplified in this release with the support for the `--remote_header` flag, which allows you to more easily separate auth credentials into a separate `.bazelrc` file.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/api-header.png)\\n\\n- **Organization creation and invitations** - you can now create organizations and send invitation links to others.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/org-invites.png)\\n\\n- **Remote build execution performance and reliability improvements** - we\'ve made a whole host of changes to our remote build execution executors and schedulers to make them more fault tolerant, easier to scale, and faster. We\'ve also exposed support for executor pools on BuildBuddy Enterprise which allow you to route remote execution traffic based on OS, CPU architecture, GPU requirements, CPU/memory requirements, and more. Routing can be configured at both the platform and individual target level. Finally, we\'ve added improved documentation to help get up and running with RBE more quickly.\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.

We\u2019ve made lots of improvements in this release based on your feedback.\\n\\nOur focus for this release was on giving users new tools to improve build performance, debug cache hits, and a completely redesigned Cloud & Enterprise experience.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New to Open Source BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Timing profile explorer **- Bazel\'s timing profile is the best way to get detailed insights into where to spend your time optimizing your build. Unfortunately, extracting useful information out of the thousands of events can be challenging without using something like Chrome\'s profiling tools. Now we\'ve built these tools right into the BuildBuddy timing tab so you can explore this info for any build. See which actions dominate your build\'s critical path or find out how much time is spent downloading outputs - now with a single click.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/timing-profile.png)\\n\\nDive into the timing for every action, critical path information, and more.\\n\\n- **Cache stats **- one of the feature requests we get most frequently is for more information on cache hits and misses. This data can be tricky to get a hold of because it\'s not made easily available by Bazel\'s build event protocol. That\'s why we\'ve introduced BuildBuddy\'s new cache tab. It gives you a view into cache hits, misses, and writes for every invocation that uses BuildBuddy\'s gRPC cache. It breaks these numbers down by action cache (AC) and content addressable store (CAS). BuildBuddy also tracks the volume and throughput of cache requests so you can see how much data is moving in and out of the cache - and at what speed.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/cache-stats.png)\\n\\nGet a view into cache performance for every invocation.\\n\\n- **Environment variable redaction controls** - when debugging cache hits, it can be useful to get a full picture of the inputs that are affecting a particular build - like the PATH environment variable. By default, BuildBuddy redacts nearly all environment variables passed into Bazel. We\'ve added controls per invocation that allow you to optionally allow environment variables of your choice to skip redaction. Information on configuring this can be found in our[ build metadata docs](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/guide-metadata#environment-variable-redacting).\\n\\n## New to Cloud & Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Redesigned navigation **- as BuildBuddy has grown from a debugging tool to a fully-featured platform to debug, analyze, monitor, and share builds across your organization, we\'ve outgrown the minimal navigation setup that has gotten us this far. In Cloud and Enterprise BuildBuddy, we\'ve replaced the top menu bar with a more fully-featured left-nav. This gives us room to add new features like Trends and provides easier access to critical pages like Setup & Docs.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/navigation.png)\\n\\nThe new navigation makes room for new features.\\n\\n- **Trends **- BuildBuddy has lots of information about every invocation that it collects. Now with Trends, you can follow how your builds are changing over time. Have all of the cache improvements you\'ve been working on decreased average build time over the last month? Has the addition of a new external dependency significantly increased the length of your slowest builds? Answering these questions is easy with BuildBuddy Trends.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/trends-v0.png)\\n\\n- **Redis Pub/Sub support **- we\'ve added support for Redis Pub/Sub to significantly improve remote build execution performance. It\'s completely optional for on-prem deployments, but in our testing it\'s improved performance for builds with lots of small actions by a factor of 2x. No change is required for Cloud users - just enjoy the faster builds!\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for this release.

He\'ll start off focused on surfacing better profiling and timing information to help users track down and fix slow builds!\\n\\nOur focus for this release was on expanding access to BuildBuddy as well as improving scalability and performance.\\n\\nWe\'re also excited to announce that we\'re expanding the BuildBuddy Cloud free tier. BuildBuddy Cloud is now **free for teams of up to 3 engineers** in addition to being free for individuals open source projects of any size.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New to Open Source BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Official BuildBuddy Helm charts** - thanks to a [request](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/issues/35) from [Nathan Leung](https://github.com/nathanhleung) we\'ve created official [BuildBuddy Helm Charts](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm) that are available for both [Open Source](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm/tree/master/charts/buildbuddy) and [Enterprise](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-helm/tree/master/charts/buildbuddy-enterprise) deployments. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) enables you to deploy BuildBuddy to a Kubernetes cluster with a single command, and makes configuration a breeze. The charts can optionally take care of provisioning a MySQL instance, an Nginx ingress, and even Memcached.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/helm.png)\\n\\n- **Build metadata** - a frequent request from users is the ability to associate a BuildBuddy invocation with a particular git commit and repo. To support this, we\'ve added optional build metadata including repo URL, commit SHA, and CI role that can be passed up with your build. This metadata can be passed up using the `--build_metadata` flag, using a `--workspace_status_command` script, or using environment variables commonly set by CI providers like CircleCI, BuildKite, GitHub Actions, and others. More information on how to configure your metadata can be found in our [build metadata guide.](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/guide-metadata)\\n\\n- **GitHub commit status publishing** - now that you can configure build metadata to associate invocations with a GitHub repo and commit, we\'ve added the ability to publish commit statuses straight to GitHub when you\'ve set your metadata role to **CI**. To enable this feature, simply click **Link GitHub Account** in your BuildBuddy profile dropdown (if you\'re using self hosted BuildBuddy, you\'ll need to [create a Github OAuth app](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/config-github) and add it to your config.yaml file).\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/commit-status.png)\\n\\nBuildBuddy links directly on GitHub\\n\\n- **Improved cache hit rate** - we\'ve made improvement to our Action Cache validation logic that should result in higher cache hit rates.\\n\\n- **New guides** - we\'ve added new guides to our documentation, including our [Authentication Guide](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/guide-auth), [Build Metadata Guide](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/guide-metadata), [Remote Build Execution with Github Actions Guide](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/rbe-github-actions), with more coming soon. We\'ve also started collecting troubleshooting documentation for common errors including [RBE\xa0Failures](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/troubleshooting-rbe), and [Slow Uploads](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/troubleshooting-slow-upload). Contributions [welcome](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/tree/master/docs)!\\n\\n- **Target information in timing tab** - in Bazel 3.4.0, the experimental [flag](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_profile_include_target_label) `--experimental_profile_include_target_label` was introduced which adds target information to profiling events. When this flag is enabled, this target information is now displayed in the BuildBuddy Timing tab.\\n\\n## New to Cloud & Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **BuildBuddy Cloud is now free for teams of up to 3** - we want to make BuildBuddy available to every team - regardless of size. BuildBuddy has always been free for individuals and open source projects and today we\'re expanding this to teams of up to 3 engineers. As your team continues to grow, we have reasonably priced plans that scale from startups to the largest enterprises.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/pricing.png)\\n\\n- **Distributed scheduler** - the scheduler is a core component of any remote execution platform. In many cases, it is a single point of failure that turns an otherwise robust system into a fragile, stateful service that\'s hard to scale. In BuildBuddy 1.2.1, we rewrote our **distributed** Remote Build Execution scheduler from the ground up based on many learnings and best practices from state-of-the-art systems like Apache Spark. This enables BuildBuddy to scale to handle the largest workloads with no single point of failure, single digit millisecond queue wait times, and fault tolerance that enables execution on preemptible nodes. This allows for more cost effective high availability configurations, and allows you to deploy new BuildBuddy releases without a blip in ongoing executions.\\n\\n- **Remote asset API** - in Bazel 3.0.0 the Remote Asset API was introduced along with the `--experimental_remote_downloader` [flag](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_remote_downloader). In this release, we\'ve added basic support for this experimental API.\\n\\n- **Organization configuration** - we\'ve added configuration options for on-prem installs that allow you to configure an organization\'s name and limit signups to emails from a specific domain. More information in the [org config documentation](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/config-org).\\n\\n- **Configurable anonymous access** - we\'ve added a configuration option that allows organizations with authentication configured to choose whether or not anonymous access should be enabled. Anonymous access is off by default when auth is configured.

We\'ve made lots of improvements in this release based on your feedback.\\n\\nA special thank you to our new contributors:\\n\\n- [Sergio Rodriguez Orellana](https://github.com/SrodriguezO) who contributed support for making dense mode the default view mode.\\n- [Tim Glaser](https://twitter.com/timgl?lang=en) who made some major improvements to our documentation.\\n\\nOur focus for this release was on our new Remote Build Execution platform. This release marks a huge step in fulfilling our mission of making developers more productive by supporting the Bazel ecosystem.\\n\\nBuildBuddy\'s Remote Build Execution platform supports executing your Bazel build and tests in parallel across thousands of machines with automatic scaling, support for custom Docker images, and more.\xa0We\'ve been iterating on and testing BuildBuddy RBE\xa0for months with companies of different sizes, and are excited to now make it available to everyone.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhile BuildBuddy RBE is not yet fully open source, we\'re offering Cloud RBE for free to individuals and open source projects to show our appreciation to the open source community.\\n\\nWe\'ll be adding more documentation on getting started with BuildBuddy RBE\xa0in the coming weeks, but in the meantime feel free to email us at <rbe@buildbuddy.io> or ping us in the [BuildBuddy Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/buildbuddy/shared_invite/zt-e0cugoo1-GiHaFuzzOYBPQzl9rkUR_g) and we\'ll be happy to help you get started.\\n\\n## **New to Open Source BuildBuddy**\\n\\n- **Cache & remote execution badges -\xa0**BuildBuddy invocations pages now show badges that indicate whether or not caching and remote execution are enabled. Clicking on these badges takes you to instructions on how to configure these if they\'re enabled for your BuildBuddy instance.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/cache-badge.png)\\n\\n- **Remote build execution configuration options** - the BuildBuddy configuration widget has now been updated to enable configuring of remote build execution if it\'s enabled for your BuildBuddy instance.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/config-options.png)\\n\\n- **Better build status support** - BuildBuddy now better distinguishes between in-progress, failed, passed, and cancelled builds with new colorful status indicators, favicons, and more.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/favicon.png)\\n\\n- **Improved documentation and new website** - we\'ve completely revamped the BuildBuddy documentation, and it\'s now sync\'d between GitHub and [buildbuddy.io/docs/](https://buildbuddy.io/docs/), so your docs will be fresh regardless of where you\'re reading them.\xa0We\'ll be adding new sections on configuring RBE\xa0in the coming weeks. We\'ve also completely revamped the BuildBuddy website to make it easier to navigate and perform actions like requesting a quote, or subscribing to our [newsletter](#wf-form-Newsletter-Form).\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/docs.png)\\n\\n- **Test run grid** - BuildBuddy will now automatically display test runs as a grid when a single test target is run more than 10 times. This supports the use case of finding and fixing flaky tests by running them with **--runs_per_test=100**.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/test-runs.png)\\n\\n- **Performance and reliability improvements** - we put a lot of work into improving performance and reliability in this release. This includes changes like better event flushing (no more getting stuck on 15 build events), better shutdown behavior, speed improvements and optimizations in build artifact uploading and downloading, and more.\\n\\n## New to Cloud & Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Remote Build Execution** - BuildBuddy Cloud and enterprise on-prem now support Remote Build Execution. Features include custom Docker image support, automatic scaling, multiple caching layers, and more. Additional features like Mac support, viewing of remote build actions in BuildBuddy, and more are coming soon.\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/rbe.png)\\n\\n- **Invocation grouping** - BuildBuddy invocations can now be grouped by commit and by repo.\xa0These can be populated in one of three ways:\\n\\n1.  automatically by common CI\xa0environments like CircleCI and GitHub actions\\n2.  manually by using build flags **--build_metadata=REPO_URL=** and **--build_metadata=COMMIT_SHA=**\u200d\\n3.  by using a **--workspace_status_command** script like [this one](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/workspace_status.sh)\\n\\n![](../static/img/blog/commits.png)\\n\\n- **New cloud endpoint** - BuildBuddy now exposes a L7 load balanced gRPCS cloud endpoint at **cloud.buildbuddy.io** which can be used for BES, cache, and remote execution (see our [.bazelrc](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/.bazelrc#L25) for an example).\xa0We\'ll gradually be migrating users to this from the old events.buildbuddy.io, and cache.buildbuddy.io endpoints with port numbers.\\n\\n- **Easier enterprise deployment** - deploying enterprise BuildBuddy is now just as easy as deploying open source BuildBuddy, with a one line install script that deploys to your Kubernetes cluster.\xa0It takes your [BuildBuddy configuration file](https://www.buildbuddy.io/docs/config) as a parameter so you can easily configure things to your needs.\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.

This allows us to show information about individual test cases and quickly surface information on which test cases failed and why.\\n\\n- **Large log file support** - we\'ve improved BuildBuddy\'s log viewer to enable the rendering of 100MB+ log files with full ANSI color support in milliseconds using incremental rendering.\\n\\n- **Timing controls** - BuildBuddy\'s timing tab now has improved controls that enable users to choose grouping and page size options. This allows you to easily see the slowest build phases across threads.\\n\\n- **gRPCS support** - BuildBuddy now supports and defaults to encrypted gRPCS connections to Bazel using TLS. Support includes automatic obtaining of server-side TLS certificates using [ACME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment) and [Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This also includes the ability to connect to remote caches over gRPCS via the bytestream API.\\n- **URL secret redaction** - we\'ve updated our log scrubbing logic to redact any URLs that might contain secrets from uploaded build events.\\n\\nOur open source BuildBuddy distribution is targeted at individuals viewing and debugging their Bazel builds. For teams and organizations, we provide an enterprise version of BuildBuddy that adds support for team-specific features.\\n\\nMany of these Enterprise features are also available for free to individuals via [Cloud Hosted BuildBuddy](https://app.buildbuddy.io/).\\n\\n## New to Cloud & Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Certificate based auth** - authentication between Bazel and BuildBuddy can now be authenticated and encrypted using certificate-based [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).\\n- **Auth configuration widget** - using BuildBuddy\'s new configuration widget, it\'s easy to setup an auth configuration that makes sense for your team. This includes options to pull credentials into user-specific `.bazelrc` files and download generated auth certificates.\\n\\n- **Build Results API** - many teams want to do more with their build results. With BuildBuddy\'s [Build Results API](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/proto/api/v1/service.proto) - users have programmatic access to an invocation\'s targets, actions, and build artifacts. This allows teams to build out custom integrations with their existing tooling.

We really appreciate everyone who\'s taken the time to kick the tires and try it out!\\n\\nWe\'re excited to share that BuildBuddy has been run on-prem at over 20 companies, and hundreds more developers have tried our cloud-hosted version.\\n\\nPeople have found the shareable invocation links particularly useful when debugging builds remotely with co-workers while working from home. No more pasting console outputs into Pastebin!\\n\\nWe\'ve taken all of the feedback we\'ve gotten and made lots of improvements to both the open source and enterprise versions of BuildBuddy.\\n\\nOur three major focuses for this release were on better build artifact handling, better test support, and enterprise authentication. We hope these changes help you continue to build and debug software faster. Keep the feedback coming!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New to Open Source BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **Remote cache support** - we\'ve added a built-in Bazel remote cache to BuildBuddy, implementing the gRPC remote caching APIs. This allows BuildBuddy to optionally collect build artifacts, timing profile information, test logs, and more.\\n\\n- **Clickable build artifacts** - this was our most requested feature. Clicking on build artifacts in the BuildBuddy UI now downloads the artifact when using either the built-in BuildBuddy cache, or a third-party cache running in gRPC mode that supports the Byte Stream API - like [bazel-remote](https://github.com/buchgr/bazel-remote).\\n\\n- **Detailed timing information** - getting detailed timing information on your Bazel builds can be a hassle. Now BuildBuddy invocations include a new \\"Timing\\" tab - which pulls the Bazel profile logs from your build cache and displays them in a human-readable format. Stay tuned for flame charts!\\n\\n- **Viewable test logs** - digging into test logs for your Bazel runs can be a pain. Now BuildBuddy surfaces test logs directly in the UI when you click on a test target (gRPC remote cache required).\\n\\n- **Multiple test-run support** - one of our favorite features of Bazel is that it will rerun flaky tests for you. BuildBuddy now supports viewing information about multiple attempts of a single test run.\\n\\n- **Client environment variable redaction** - client environment variables are now redacted from BuildBuddy\'s invocation details to avoid over-sharing.\\n\\n- **Dense UI mode** - based on feedback on information density of the default BuildBuddy UI, we added a \\"Dense mode\\" that packs more information into every square inch.\\n\\n- **BES backend multiplexing** - we heard from some of you that you\'d like to try BuildBuddy, but were already pointing your bes_backend flag at another service. We\'ve added the build_event_proxy configuration option that allows you to specify other backends that your build events should be forwarded to. See the [configuration docs](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/CONFIG.md#buildeventproxy) for more information.\\n\\n- **Slack webhook support** - we\'ve added a configuration option that allows you to message a Slack channel when builds finish. This is a nice way of getting a quick notification when a long running build completes, or a CI build fails. See the [configuration docs](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy/blob/master/CONFIG.md#integrations) for more information.\\n\\nOur open source BuildBuddy distribution is targeted at individuals viewing and debugging their Bazel builds. For teams and organizations, we provide an enterprise version of BuildBuddy that adds support for team-specific features.\\n\\n## New to Enterprise BuildBuddy\\n\\n- **OpenID Connect auth support** - organizations can now specify an OpenID Connect provider to handle authentication for their BuildBuddy instance. This allows for the flexibility to use Google login if you use GSuite, auth services like Okta, or an in-house solution that supports OpenID Connect.\\n\\n- **Authenticated build log & cache uploads** - BuildBuddy now supports generating authenticated upload URLs for both the build event and remote cache backends. Events uploaded with authentication will be associated with your organization and will not be viewable by unauthorized clients.\\n\\n- **Organization support** - BuildBuddy now supports creating organizations that allow builds to be viewed and aggregated across your team/company.\\n\\n- **Organization build history** - with organization support comes a new view that allows you to see recent builds across your organization.\\n\\n- **User & host overviews** - you can now see all of the users and hosts that have uploaded builds to your organization. This allows you to drill into all of the builds uploaded from a CI machine for example.\\n\\n- **Build grid** - the new build grid gives you a visual overview of the build history for an organization, host, or user. This allows you to quickly find and fix failing builds.\\n\\nThat\'s it for this release.
